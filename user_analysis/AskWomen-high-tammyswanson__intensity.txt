b'A good winter jacket. Shoes, when I need them, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been wearing the same suede booties from American Eagle since high school and finally put them in the trash (\xf0\x9f\x92\x94\xf0\x9f\x98\xad) but splurging in a new pair was necessary, so no guilt. Also healthy groceries and a good mani.'
b'They did some would you rathers:\n\nSomeone asked if they\xe2\x80\x99d rather have Hannah G or Hannah B with them if stuck on a deserted island, both agreed Hannah B, although saying they love Hannah G, Hannah B would better protect them and keep them alive (Demi said she\xe2\x80\x99d kill animals with her bare teeth\xf0\x9f\x98\x82). After this Hannah G texted them saying \xe2\x80\x9cfuck you bitches I was a Girl Scout.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnother person asked what date they\xe2\x80\x99d choose to go on that\xe2\x80\x99s already happened on the season, Demi said Caelynn\xe2\x80\x99s shopping trip or Hannah G\xe2\x80\x99s spa date, Katie said Tayshia\xe2\x80\x99s bungee jumping date.\n\nThey also explained that the reason they call Hannah G Josh is because she was looking for something in Demi\xe2\x80\x99s room in the middle of the night and Demi woke up and said \xe2\x80\x9cwho\xe2\x80\x99s there?!\xe2\x80\x9d And Hannah G panicked and said \xe2\x80\x9cJosh\xe2\x80\x9d \xf0\x9f\x98\x82'
b'I keep my fridge super clean and organized but tend to keep things for awhile because I feel bad throwing them out and wasting money, I live by myself so it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to rationalize what I\xe2\x80\x99m actually going to eat all of before it expires.\n\nI kept hummus for a few weeks once, I\xe2\x80\x99d only had one or two servings and I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever smelled anything so bad \xf0\x9f\xa4\xa2 I triple bagged it and brought it directly to the trash can outside! Who knew hummus could spoil and smell so awful?!'
b'Yup! It was a video of him throwing into a trash can, the next story was of it on the counter saying he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t do that to a legend but he still made his point. It\xe2\x80\x99s gone now so I can\xe2\x80\x99t screenshot \xf0\x9f\x98\x95 I think he deleted it because I believe it was last night? It gets 24 hours to stay up.'
b'The 4M I nanny talks about death often. He plays a lot of good guys vs bad guys games where the goal is to kill the bad guys (he has a 9M brother obsessed with fortnite). He says \xe2\x80\x9cI deaded them!\xe2\x80\x9d Or \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going to dead them!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s sort of morbid and sort of cute.'
b'Went out with a guy I met on tinder last December. We met at the parking garage (I know, I know) and walked to the bar. He excused himself to go to the bathroom, and came back looking like he\xe2\x80\x99d seen a ghost. He asked if we could get out of there, and certain he was about to lure me to a dark alley to kill me, I said sure.\n\nOutside he explained his ex was in there and he didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to see her with another guy.\n\nWe get to the next place and he realizes he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have his wallet, so no ID. I drank one beer, and paid for it myself. Whatever, no biggie. BUT he kept apologizing and being self-deprecating about how the night was going. He also kept bragging about his wealth and how many famous people he knew.\n\nWe left and walked back to the parking garage. I said, \xe2\x80\x9coh here\xe2\x80\x99s my car!\xe2\x80\x9d And he said \xe2\x80\x9cOh... I thought we were going to get my wallet so we could go somewhere else...? Or do you want to go back to someone\xe2\x80\x99s house?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNo dude.'
b'I\xe2\x80\x99m 23, my close friends are older and have children. I see my closest friend at least once a week, sometimes we go out to dinner with her son or we\xe2\x80\x99ll get takeout or just hang out at either of our house\xe2\x80\x99s and watch trash TV. '
