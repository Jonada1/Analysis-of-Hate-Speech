b'I describe myself as "killing time until I die". \n\nI don\'t really have a good reason to kill myself even if I often feel like doing so. There\'s a lot of good things in my life, but I am very isolated and lonely. I feel as though it doens\'t make a difference if I die today or 20 years from now. The result will be the same. I will be dead and some relatives will pillage my savings and throw away all my crap. I won\'t leave any children of my own on this world so to me that makes my entire life worthless and meaningless. \n\nBut my house is paid off, my car paid off, I have money in the bank, a decent job that isn\'t horrible, and lots of free time. I just don\'t have meaning and I\'ve given up trying to find it.'
b"The tl;dr is misleading because you don't have an hard proof that she's cheating. You have a box that you found in the trash and your wife has basically kicked you out of the house for asking about it. \n\nIt appears she has been unfaithful based on circumstantial evidence.  The box is powerful evidence, but her kicking you out is inconclusive. \n\nHas she ever cheated before? Has she ever turned something on you and blamed you for it before? \n\nI've not seen the original post so apologies if my questions are redundant. \n\nFrankly, I don't trust women very much and if what you said is accurate and true then she has over reacted to your request for information. You never accused her. You merely asked her why that box was in the trash. \n\nIf I was a betting man I'd say she cheated, but you are the one rolling the dice on divorce. Those things are expensive and it might not turn out the way you think it should."
b'People who talk about other people behind their back will talk about you behind your back as well. Mark them in your memory and watch what you say around them. \n\nA guy I work with one day said another guy was a liar. He might be right, but I think the other guy maybe just embellishes things. At least he has never lied to me that I know of. I simply responded, "I like him. He seems alright."\n\nThat ended that gossip session. I didn\'t participate in the gossip and I didn\'t vouch for the guy. I just said I liked him and suggested he\'d done me no wrong. \n\nI made a delivery and the customer said something about our drivers not helping unload. He also said he really liked one of our drivers. I asked what he liked about him and his answer was kind of vague. When I got back to work my boss asked me why I was trash talking that driver. I literally said nothing bad about the driver and was merely asking for feedback about him. The guy at the site either misunderstood me or was trying to make drama. I spoke to the driver and told him so and it ended there. It wasn\'t really hard to fix things since everyone knows I will say shit right to someone\'s face if I don\'t like them, but I\'m not going to go around behind them and talk shit. \n\nThey hired a new driver once. I was asked to go with him on a local delivery and evaluate him. We got to the truck and I started talking about company policies and the character of the truck we were going to take and he squared off on me and said he didn\'t need me telling him how to drive a truck and how he knew more than me and everyone else there. I squared off on him I\'m not his supervisor but there are things about this company that you don\'t know and will make your life easier to know. I also pointed out that a person who thinks he knows everything is a person that can\'t learn from his mistakes and that makes him a danger on the road. \n\nSince I wasn\'t his supervisor I got in the truck and let him drive. Everything went fine on the delivery. He was willing to work and didn\'t mind doing extra with the unloading even though he\'s only required to move stuff to the back of the trailer. When we got back I told him he ran 3 stop signs. \n\nI then told my boss that this guy was likely a psychopath and that he\'s going to wreck a truck. It may not "technically" be his fault but he will refuse to yield when doing so could avoid an accident because he feels he\'s right and can\'t be wrong and therefore it\'s the other guys problem. That is exactly the mentality of a psychopath. \n\nHis second week he wrecked his truck. A vehicle merged into his lane and pushed him into the concrete barrier. He admitted that he saw the guy coming, but he didn\'t try to slow down to avoid him. \n\nIt\'s not his fault but he could have prevented it. They fired him a few days later.'
b"A dead crossbowman never runs out of ammo. \n\nIn defense the board shield isn't that important. \n\nI'll put all my archers at the top of the queue and they'll win the ranged battle, deplete some of the melee units and then I'll retreat them (if it's allowed) or charge them up the ladder. They die, (wounded with high surgery) more archers spawn and I do it all over again. \n\nCrossbowmen can never gain a ranged advantage against archers. \n\nDo you know why little England conquered half the world? Because rate of fire matters. The faster they could load a musket and fire meant the faster they could kill or disperse their enemies. The same goes for archers. \n\nIt doesn't matter if they run out of arrows first. If all the crossbowmen die then it doesn't matter how many bolts are left in their quivers.\n\nAnd I agree that a bow is a game winner if the PC has one. He can move to pick off enemy ranged units from directions that NPC archers can't aim from. He can suppress and kill archers that would wreck his guys on the ladders. Also, more troops fire arrows rather than bolts so it's easier for PC to get more ammo in most battles."
b"Fake!\n\nWe all know ya'll be throwin the trash out the window."
b'I feel the same. I got to episode 3 last night and I already knew what was going to happen the moment he stopped her from getting on the train. Things went downhill there when he went into the club (after standing in line). \n\nFor starters he literally was saying to his baby early in the episode, "Daddy\'s going to die", repeatedly in a mocking tone. The baby can\'t understand but the audience can. \n\nAnd then they start humanizing him more by showing that he has a good friend in Berlin, that he\'s married, that he\'s gay, as well as being a good father. And then Eve and Bill are talking and getting close in the hotel room. The whole point is to make us care about this guy just so they can kill him off (stupidly) by the end of the episode. \n\nFirst, the whole episode seems to be about fleshing out his character just so they could kill him for drama\'s sake. It doesn\'t advance the plot. What it ultimately is is the gratuitous killing of another person (almost always males) for our entertainment. \n\nIt wasn\'t smartly done. There was nothing clever about it. It was just bonehead stupidity and the whole thing pissed me off. \n\nI never actually saw him die, mind you. I quit the show the moment he went into the club. I knew what was going to happen and I didn\'t want to see it. \n\nBut other than that I really dislike Eve. She lies constantly to her husband, is in a job that she\'s not qualified for, repeatedly makes mistakes for which she learns no lessons and through it all I don\'t see her growing as a person or character. She\'s just going to do the same stupid shit over and over again. How many more people will die from her bungling? \n\nIf MI6 suspects an assassin is killing all these people and then one day the assassin uses Eve\'s name during the killing of a high profile Chinese asset then who the fuck wouldn\'t want to put some security on her? Oh but, "she\'s not official" you say. Sure, but there are other people investigating who are official and they know who she is and that she\'s investigating the murders and no one is competent enough to think maybe they should watch her? \n\nAnd of course she shows up at the crime scene because, why? She\'s not a forensics expert. She had no business there but by going to the scene she makes it possible for her to be spotted. \n\nWhat was there to learn at the crime scene anyway? Everything was done. Even the body had already been autopsied. That often takes days or weeks, but in this show it\'s done in a couple hours. That\'s just stupid writing that insults the watcher. \n\nI can\'t believe this show was rated as one of the best shows on TV right now. \n\nI do like the psychopath. She gives a good portrayal of someone who has no emotions or conscience. Often she looks at someone and waits for them to respond emotionally before she knows how to respond herself. Death is an interesting curiosity and sex is the closest she\'ll get to "fun" as there is no actual intimacy or love. Just the workings of her sex.'
b"Don't eat refined sugar or your joints will stiffen up and you'll be in pain all the time. Also keep carbs at a minimum for the same reason.\n\nWalking for more than a few minutes or standing for about 10 or more minutes will cause the sciatic nerve to be pinched and you'll be in agony until you can sit down for awhile. \n\nAt any moment that you stop doing anything and think about your life you will suggest to yourself that you should kill yourself.\n\nAny dumb mistake or apparently lack of ability has only one response--thoughts of suicide. \n\nIf you are driving you won't have to pee for 8 hours or more no matter what you drink. \n\nYou'll refuse to poop anywhere but in your own toilet. \n\nRandomly oscillate between being overly concerned or completely shocked and disgusted by real scenes of violence, injury, or death to being completely immune and analytical and you won't know why."
b'I\'m going to disagree. \n\nEverywhere in the world there are men at the bottom of the heap who consider violence the only way to get out. Look at the murder rate in the US. Over 17,000 in 2016. That\'s out of a population of about 325 million. \n\nIn 2017 there were about 26,000 people killed as a result of terrorist attacks. That\'s out of a total Muslim population of 1.8 billion. \n\nThat\'s 1 murder out of every 69,231 Muslims.\n\nCompare that to the 1 murder out of every 19,117 Americans. \n\nWe can refine this down even further by pointing out that Blacks commit about 52% of homicides but only make up about 13% of the US population.\n\nSo out of the 42,250,000 blacks in the US they commit 8840 of the murders. That\'s 1 for every 4779 blacks. \n\nSo, comparatively speaking, blacks in the US are a far greater threat than Muslims worldwide. Of course, this math doesn\'t take into consideration that blacks tend to kill a 1 or 2 people per murderer and Islamic Extremists might kill dozens or more per murderer. \n\nWe could also consider the number of people killed by the US since WWII. That\'s about 20 million. That\'s an average of 273,972 per year for the last 73 years. \n\nWhen we look at that number it\'s more understandable why people don\'t like the US. Frankly, the US makes Islamic terrorism look like rank amateurs.  They are the "Barney" of violence and mayhem compared to the US. \n\nhttps://www.globalresearch.ca/us-has-killed-more-than-20-million-people-in-37-victim-nations-since-world-war-ii/5492051\n\nEdit: And I will add this. What\'s wrong with young women in the Middle East whoring themselves? They do it in the US for free. Do you think all those underage pelfies are getting sent out by force? Do you think that when Britney Spears was a minor that she wasn\'t using her sexuality to sell records and make money? Plenty of women use their sex to get stuff without having to work at a real job. We call them thots. In the Iraq they are just whores. It ain\'t right, but it ain\'t much different than the US. Wherever you go you will find people who want to make an easy buck or get ahead using an exploit. Some guys do it by stealing and killing and some women do it by whoring or posting nude photos on Instagram. It\'s hardly a reason to exterminate a people. If it was then the US should be first in line.'
