b'If they wanted to protect their children, if they truly, really wanted to protect them, they would get them vaccinated. These people do not care one iota about their kids, or any kids, or any other human beings. They\'re worse than idiots, they\'re actually bio-terrorists. They choose to "believe" their fantasy, which makes them feel superior to everyone, \'cause they *know* more, so nobody can tell them anything to make them stop believing in "their truth". Never mind all the scientifically verifiable facts that prove them wrong. Their willful ignorance harms innocent people, young and old, just like a terrorist who thinks they know the way, the one true way and all \'non-believers\' must die/be purified.\n\nYa can\'t fix stupid, and ya can\'t legally kill it. If only there were a super strong vaccine for that!'
