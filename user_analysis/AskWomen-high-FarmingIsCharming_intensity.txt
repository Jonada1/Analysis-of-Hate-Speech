b"My mother was saying she wanted to kill herself and that she would kill my siblings before that so they don't suffer. All i could feel back then was deep sadness and heart ache why am i not good enough to be killed too.\nTrying to deal with childhood trauma to this very day and I am 32. Literally affected every aspect in my life but mostly relationships with other people. \n"
