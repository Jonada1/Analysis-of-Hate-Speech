b"The only way you will kick it is to learn to tolerant *not* feeling OK... And then to learn to change the feelings. But the first part is to live with your emotions without acting on them. Feelings can't kill you. Only the actions you take that stem from them can.\n\nThere's a book I often recommend called *Man's Search for Meaning*. It's written by Victor Frankl, a man who survived a concentration camp. No one could have blamed him if he concluded life wasn't worth living during or after that experience. But instead, it taught him to look at his feelings differently. It was the only way for him to survive, but it also spawned a psychological movement to help people locked in a cage of their own creation. "
b"Yep.\n\nI was in your shoes at 18. My life got a ton better in the next couple of years. The stuff I thought I had fucked up that couldn't be fixed didn't even factor into my life 5 years later.\n\nThe hard lesson was that emotions do not have to kill you. Emotions aren't running the show. You can feel sad or angry and *not do anything about it.* You can also change your actions, which will change your thoughts. If you change your thoughts, your feelings change too. At 18 I had that backwards. I thought I couldn't do anything about my feelings. Small changes in routine can make a huge difference in how you feel.\n"
