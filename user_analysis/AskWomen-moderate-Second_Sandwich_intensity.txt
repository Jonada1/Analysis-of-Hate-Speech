She would constantly talk badly about them and then as I got older I just automatically assumed that if you had money you were mean, entitled, and would look down on me for not having it. \n\nI started to realize that this wasn't the case with most people when I started to become friends with kids that lived in a more well off family and realized that, yeah their lives looked a bit different from mine, but they didn't dislike me for it.
