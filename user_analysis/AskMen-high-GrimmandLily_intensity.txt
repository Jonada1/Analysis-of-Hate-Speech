b'Chores (catboxes, laundry, dishes, trash, etc), masturbate, play guitar, figure out what I\xe2\x80\x99m going to eat, pay bills, balance my register. Boring shit like that during the week. It helps me have more free time on my days off. \n\nI\xe2\x80\x99m 45. '
b'Does this car have a neutral safety switch? In the old days if the switch went bad it would kill the reverse lights. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if that\xe2\x80\x99s still a thing though. '
b'I had a buddy (we were teenagers) and he literally had so much trash in his car I had to stomp it down to get into the front passenger seat. Every now and then we would clean it out and it was always at least a couple 30 gallon trash bags worth. '
b'Every Samsung. They\xe2\x80\x99re always trash. '
b'I\xe2\x80\x99ve driven a lot of garbage rental cars. The Chevy Cruze is a horrid, soulless piece of trash even for an econobox. Dodge Nitro is fun if you always want to feel like you\xe2\x80\x99re about to rollover. Ford Fiesta, rattling down a road near you. Hyundai Veloster, slow, cramped, ridiculous interior. \n\nI\xe2\x80\x99m sure there\xe2\x80\x99s more but those are off the top of my head. '
b'Busboy, fast food worker, file clerk, clerk, keyholder, courier, mainframe operator, lead operator, mainframe operator/production support, production support analyst, system administrator, mainframe operator, system administrator, analyst. \n\nWelp, I\xe2\x80\x99m trash. '
b'My dad died of pancreatic cancer in 2009. I\xe2\x80\x99m definitely not over it but I get through most days without too much trouble. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think anything could have prepared me for that. I do know that if I get cancer and they tell me it\xe2\x80\x99s terminal, I\xe2\x80\x99ll kill myself. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to go through what he went through. '
b'Absolutely beautiful baby. Would happily let it kill me. '
b'Every Samsung phone I\xe2\x80\x99ve owned has been trash. '
b'I\xe2\x80\x99m 6\xe2\x80\x992 and absolutely trash. Height doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter. '
b'We found a tiny kitten in the trash 5 years ago. We thought he was a couple weeks old because he was so small. Vet checked him out and he was actually a few months old, just under nourished. Now he\xe2\x80\x99s a huge, lovable monster. '
b'If there is a lot like a bushy beard I gather it up and toss it in the trash can. If it\xe2\x80\x99s just some stubble I rinse it down the sink. '
b'Tissue and trash can or toilet. '
