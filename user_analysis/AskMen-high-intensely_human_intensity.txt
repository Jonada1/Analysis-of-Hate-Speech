b'Your friends are arbitrarily drawing a line between their set of experiences and yours and calling that line wisdom.  \n\nHow can we assume you are emotionally mature before you:  \n\n* have children  \n* have a child die  \n* save a life  \n* save the life of a monster who ends up killing ten innocent people  \n* kill a person  \n* kill an innocent person out of fear  \n* kill an innocent person to save ten other innocent people  \n* lead a nation into war  \n* invent a cure for a disease \n* lose a limb  \n* eat 400 micrograms of acid in one go  \n* die  \n* watch a business you started succeed wildly  \n* watch a business you started turn into something horrible the hurts people  \n* etc  \n\n\n'
b'It\'s not just that it\'s negatively stigmatized. It\'s that it\'s very poorly described.  \n\nPeople attribute every negative quality a human can have to anti-vaxxers. If you ask someone to describe anti-vaxxers, they\'ll say they\'d rather have their kids die than have autism (false), they\'ll say they are selfish and hate their kids (false), they\'ll say they\'re immoral and stupid and they never read anything about science, they\'ll say you can\'t talk to an anti-vaxxer, they\'ll say anti-vaxxers don\'t understand logic, they\'ll attribute all sorts of paranoia and insanity, etc.  \n\nWhen in reality, and anti-vaxxer is characterized by one thing: they don\'t vaccinate their kids.  \n\nAll the other stuff is lumped in there because, hey, fuck truth when there\'s something important on the line to be achieved through lying right?  \n\nSo given the definition of "doesn\'t vaccinate their kids, and is a worthless piece of human trash generally", of course this guy doesn\'t think he\'s an anti-vaxxer. By the definition being bandied about, he isn\'t. If an anti-vaxxer doesn\'t love their children then he\'s not an anti-vaxxer because he loves his kids, etc.  \n\nMaybe if people used precise language, and didn\'t cartoonishly vilify anti-vaxxers, then there wouldn\'t be confusion about who\'s an anti-vaxxer and who isn\'t.  \n\nAlso when the fuck is ios going to add "vaxxer" to its dictionary? It\'s so annoying to type and anti-correct each time.  \n\n'
b"That sounds like a serious conundrum. It's very unnerving to be in that split mind state, knowing you must proceed and yet craving to stay.  \n\nI recently spent a period of time avoiding a change I knew I must make, a change that required me to kill an old part of myself, a part of my moral identity that had formed at a very young age.  \n\nI got through the moment, and did the thing, and traded sick order for fresh chaos, and my mind is less conflicted now (though my circumstances got harder). I'm in the whitewater consequences of that very disruptive change now, and I'm certainly facing all the things I was afraid of facing, so I was right about how making that move would bring all this hardship, but I'm so much more relieved now than before.  \n\nI'm in purgatory now, but I was in hell this summer. Being frozen in indecision is a horrible state I wouldn't wish on anybody.  "
b"Maybe it's in the middle, and it instinctively knows to cover holes when trying to kill something. \n\nAlso the shark could provide the information to the octopus. If the octopus runs its tentacles around the shark's body, and the shark shows more fear at certain tentacle positions, the octopus could just be in a feedback loop attempting to follow the path of most increasing fear in the shark.  \n\nBoth look-for-holes and follow-its-fear could be simple instinctual programs for how to kill a wide array of animals.  \n\nJust like on land predators have the instinct to bite the neck because I guess necks are land animals' universal weak spot.  Maybe holes are sea creatures' universal weak spot."
b"Okay let me give you what I think you're saying.  You're saying that it's the same if you commit murder to if you have someone committing murder on your behalf, or as part of a group you're supporting.  \n\nI think you're equating a republican being willing to murder someone personally, with a republican being in favor of their government murdering someone.  \n\nThat's the thing that seems to map to your comment's contents. But what confuses me is that it doesn't establish anything about the relative weight of death and torture as a thing to be avoided/minimized in the minds of right vs left.  \n\nYes, outsourced killing is morally equivalent to in-house killing. So a righty who is in favor of the government killing is the same being in favor of himself killing.  \n\nBut I don't see how that advances the idea that the righty is more in favor of death or even murder.  \n\nLet's get rid of all the proxy stuff and go to a single person example, so there's no conspiracy involved.  \n\nOne person is willing to kill, and another is not. You get a situation where killing a person saves two other people. One guy kills and saves two lives, the other refuses to kill and lets two people die. \n\nWhich of those two people is more in favor of death? Also if a non-killer has an opportunity to save two lives from being murdered and they don't, to what degree is that non-killer now guilty of conspiracy to commit murder?  \n\n"
b'Well that makes sense.  There are a lot of acupressure points in your hands so you were probably using the pain and the pressure to help process stuff mentally. \n\nI tend to be a lot more comfortable with freaky shit like that than most people. I used to be really worried that I was gonna do something stupid and kill myself or drive myself crazy while tripping, but after a couple of terrifying experiences in life where I was close to death (in one case) or thought I was close to death (in another case), the whole danger/insanity aspect of tripping seemed less scary to me.  \n\nI guess I have a much greater trust in the subconscious layers of my nervous system than I had before.  \n\nI remember a year or so ago I took some acid with my then girlfriend.  Really early on, as the waves of energy started coming through my body, I started getting this desire to just contort and be catatonic.  I was just twisting around to get some tension out, and my muscles wanted to vibrate a bit so I was vibrating and jiggling and I realize it must look like pretty weird so I managed to mumble out "I\'m okay, this feels good".  \n\nI could have used my prefrontal cortex and locked down on that shit and got control of myself, but it was cathartic and it felt good and it was just something my body had to do.  And I felt fantastic afterwards.  \n\nSometimes you gotta do that weird shit man.  Just make sure you\'re around people who won\'t freak out at it.  Especially sober people who haven\'t tripped before.  They see you nibbling on your skin they\'ll think you\'re devolving into an ape man or something and they\'ll freak out.'
b'> Like, "the guy in a coma didn\'t know we were going to kill him so he didn\'t feel any fear so it was fine."  \n\nNot permitted because if it were allowed anybody who *might* fall into a coma would fear doing so more than they would fear it in a society where a person in a coma has a right to life.  \n\nSorry I should have been more clear: once you get a right to life you keep it until you die. So you don\'t lose the right to life while you\'re asleep.  \n\n> a while  \n\nI could have made the argument without the word "a while". It\'s not worth focusing on. The point was that it is attained with the awareness of death. \n\nThe argument is that the awareness of death gives it its most meaningful terror. The sanctity of life has a utilitarian role and that role is to remove terror from the minds of society, terror which precedes expected death. \n\n> Killing babies  \n\nYes that does emerge from this as permitted. It does certainly seem horrible, and I think that instinct is a valid one. Maybe, despite the very real lack of suffering in the scenario on the baby\'s part, the very real suffering of a society that kills babies already born is the simple and sufficient reason not to permit it.  \n\nSo you\'re right: the principle of personhood I put forth does not itself give us a solution for infanticide, because babies aren\'t persons by that definition. But we could extend personhood to babies on the basis of: doing so causes infanticide, and infanticide causes suffering, even for those not directly involved in it, i.e. a society where infanticide is legal is less happy than a society where it\'s not.  \n\nWhat\'s wrong with that argument?'
b'The reason I personally am okay with it is because I don\'t think the death of an unborn baby causes suffering like the death of a person who\'s been conscious for a while.  \n\nWhen you\'ve got your eyes open and you\'re interacting in the world you\'re becoming attached to life and developing an awareness of the difference between death and life.  Death\'s badness comes from this attachment, from this knowledge of life and death.  The knowledge of life and the understanding of death come together to create the fear of death.  An unborn baby doesn\'t have the knowledge of life and the understanding of death to combine into this fear.  \n\nIf a little kid lives in a society where it\'s legal to kill little kids, that little kid will suffer mentally from that knowledge.  \n\nBut if an unborn baby lives in a society where it\'s legal to kill unborn babies, that unborn baby is none the worse for it.  \n\nIt hasn\'t yet started its *attached* life.  It hasn\'t breathed and seen and experienced and begun to learn and understand, and it hasn\'t gotten anywhere close to that understanding of death that would make it afraid.  \n\nAnd then once you take away the fear of death, you are left with the physical pain.  If a person is killed with absolutely no suspicion that it\'s coming, like a silent bullet to the back of the head on a random day, then you are left with the pain of death being death\'s impact on the killed.  \n\nAn abortion is probably pretty painful for a fetus, assuming it can feel pain.  It would basically be the same as dying in an industrial accident.  \n\nBut I don\'t consider it to be a human consciousness that suffers that pain.  A cow\'s consciousness, at time of slaughter, is at least as cognizant and differentiated as a fetus\'s, and I eat beef.  So if I\'m opposed to abortion on the basis of the pain being felt, I have to stop eating animals to be morally consistent.  \n\nSo I guess I\'m operating by the rule that if it doesn\'t have a person\'s mind, the pain it feels isn\'t morally relevant.  That\'s probably bunk but at least it\'s consistent with eating meat.  \n\nAnd by "person\'s mind" I mean that it knows life and it understands death and therefore it has the capacity to suffer if it understands that it might be killed.  I think the preceding is the basis for a right to life.  When you can be aware of what a right to life is, and why you might want one, you get one.  \n\nThis applies not just to homo sapiens bodies, but also to robots.  Any system that understands death and fears it is given a right to life.  '
b"Nature is always out of balance.  Life exists because of that imbalance, that catastrophe.  The apparent balance of nature was like the apparent steadiness of a heartbeat:  in one timescale it's ongoing but on another it's part of a process with a beginning, middle, and end.  All hearts beat for a while and then die, and whether that heart is in balance is a matter of how you're looking at it.  \n\nHuman civilization has accelerated the change, but it didn't introduce it.  It's like when the nanobots are changing your body.  It may seem like they are stopping a beating heart, but really they are just making it stop faster than it was going to otherwise.  \n\nWhether those nanobots are a horror or a blessing for that body, or both, depends on what they are building in that heart's place.  If they're making something beautiful, they redeem themselves for their murder.  But if they just build the next thing, they are the same as all the things that ever killed any other human before.  \n\nLike the nanobots, we are an extinguishing factor.  Earth has had extinguishers for a long time; its history is unrelenting extinction and replacement.  But also like the nanobots who don't just kill you but kill you piecemeal to make you better, maybe we humans can not just kill this biosphere but rather kill it piecemeal to make it better.  \n\nMaybe death by nanobots is the best death there is.  I don't think the death of our biosphere is too realistically going to be avoided.  Yes we may save 10% or 50% of species, but the planet will never return to the way it operated before our civilization.  You can save 50% of the cells in a human body and still be left with colonies of bacteria living in a corpse that has changed in some fundamental way the bacteria cannot understand.  Maybe Gaia is already dead and we must replace her.  Or AI must.  \n\nWe can have a collection of Earth based species who live together symbiotically, and we can even continue running such a collection on Earth, but civilization is at the point where it won't be able to get its womb environment back.  \n\nIf Gaia is dead, and I think there's a good chance it's just true, and if we can't change that our only option is to try to make that death worth it.  We have to do what we can to ensure that death is part of and not the end of a developmental process.  \n\nMaybe we'll be lucky and the machines will respect our natural lives.  But can human life ever be natural again if it's exactly the same ... but optional?  What if the machines respect us enough to not *forcibly* upgrade our brains and bodies?  Even then, is humanity preserved?  Isn't death and disease, and all the decisions we make in the face of those things, irrevocably part of the human experience?  If the doorway to godhood is open, are the people standing before that door still human?  Or are they already posthuman simply because of the option?  "
b"I'd say write about it.  When something is fucking with your head, that's not always just some illusion that you need to kill.  \n\nI'd say you've got a serious problem which is that you need to get some experience under your belt.  Your instinct to grow and learn is pushing you to grow and learn.  \n\nSo you stop the mindfuck by itching that scratch and you find ways to broaden your experience.  \n\nI will say this, regarding serious relationships at the level of marriage.  I'm 36, and I'm feeling like I've almost missed the boat on kids.  Friends of mine my age have kids who are already growing up, and it hurts my insides when I think about it.  \n\nIMO a good age to be having kids is maybe 28-30.  \n\nI could go on and on, but I just wanted to give you that perspective:  do crazy shit when you are young.  That's what youth is for.  Just don't ruin yourself.  If you feel a problem in your gut when you think about your level of experience, *don't ignore it*"
b"It needs to be public because the world needs to know we will respond to those who kill Americans.  We can't be seen simply allowing an attack without a retaliation."
