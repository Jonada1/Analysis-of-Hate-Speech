b'It absolutely disgusts me that one customer/situation can absolutely screw over someone. Oh, 99% of the time you were amazing but this 1% time it lined up for you to get an insanely crazy person? \n\nLol nope, let\'s kill a employee\'s motivation to teach them a lesson, ignoring the fact that they\'ve been good up till this point.\n\nI worked at Wal-Mart once and was fired due to "no call no show". Problem was, I checked my schedule and didn\'t work the day I "skipped". So either I looked at my schedule wrong or my schedule was changed on me (which has happened to some employees before). Instead of going by my good track record; direct supervisor and long term employees liked me, showed up on time, was always doing what I could.\n\n They fired me, and another supervisor that I didn\'t work with much was in on the firing meeting. She told me I just wanted to skip even when I told my side of the story. Still pisses me off to this day because my word didn\'t matter, all that mattered was "Karen" thought I just wanted a free day off.'
