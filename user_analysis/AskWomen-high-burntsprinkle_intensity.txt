b'The teachers in my school were extremely cruel.  I certainly didn\xe2\x80\x99t suffer as much as a lot of students.  I was a terrible student but I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t that disruptive so I was just called stupid a lot.  I guess it didn\xe2\x80\x99t really bother me.  I thought they were all to me, just fat old mean men and women ogres.  They were revolting on the inside and outside and just something to deal with.  However looking back it hurts me how they treated poor students or kids with disabilities or physical problems.  Those teachers were abusive and I hope they are all dead.  I can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine how many lives, generations they ruined and how many terrible self fulfilling prophesies they created.  I sincerely hope if you are cruel you do NOT work with children and if you take the job and hate it then go into administration or something.  My school didn\xe2\x80\x99t have the regular bullies like most schools.  We had 50 year olds telling kids they were white trash becasue their clothes had holes in them in front of an entire class.  Or that they were fat becasue they were lazy and they were above reproach unlike regular bullies who sometimes face consequences. \n\nThe black kids had it the worst, unless they played sports.  You can not tell me that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t stay with a person their entire life.  Dispicable.   I remember looking down and rapidly blinking to keep from crying when they berated my classmates and I think that\xe2\x80\x99s what we all did.   It was always worse when it was someone else instead of you.   I guess that\xe2\x80\x99s how we all just thought school and teachers were.  Nobody ever said anything as far as I know becasue none of us knew any better and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure not a god damn person at that school district would have cared anyway. '
b'Well let\xe2\x80\x99s start at the Scientology thingy and if the food sucks, and they don\xe2\x80\x99t kill us or blackmail us into servitude we\xe2\x80\x99ll hit up Burger King.  I heard they have onion rings! '
b'I used to work in a catering company and they took the giant tubs of mayonnaise and mixed in a seasoning packet and called it a day.  People ate that up like it was liquid gold.   Cups of it.   They put it on everything green beans almondine, trout, filet mignon, pasta.  So to me, ranch dressing will always be the white trash of dressings and dips.   '
b'I worked in the the day and someone offered me to go to their house and bartend at night.  They \xe2\x80\x9ccouldn\xe2\x80\x99t pay me but I\xe2\x80\x99d get to spend time with them\xe2\x80\x9d. \n\nHahahahahahahaha!  I\xe2\x80\x99d rather kill myself.  I was in the weeds and laughed right in his face for a good 10 seconds.  It really did give me a good laugh. '
b'I like him because he says mr. Worldwide at the beginning of his songs and I think that\xe2\x80\x99s really nice of him because then I know it\xe2\x80\x99s trash immediately and I can turn it instead of wasting valuable seconds.  Very considerate of him. '
b'I have to agree.  No. I hate the people I hate for what they\xe2\x80\x99ve done to me not who they are.   Regardless, I have many faults and terrible flaws, but not the ones the people I hate do.   This quote is trash.   \n\nFurthermore did all the victims of the nazis hate them because they were part of them them? Ludicrous. '
b'Most of the time I pretend not to hear sexist comments or I pretend to be to stupid to \xe2\x80\x9cget them\xe2\x80\x9d.  I\xe2\x80\x99m not trying to fight witt people every day or take things personally from people who I consider gutter trash if I even consider them at all.  They are just a walking dollar to me and if she invests any emotional energy in it, she better start buying Kleenex at Costco. \n\nWow are those real?!  \n\nNo they are replication Mexican tiles.  Are you ready to order or would you like a few more minutes?   \n\n'
b'Worked up over your ignorance and insolence?  I don\xe2\x80\x99t think so.  Afford insurance?  How much is insurance? I\xe2\x80\x99m sure it\xe2\x80\x99s cheap I\xe2\x80\x99ve had it since I was 15.  Anyway I haven\xe2\x80\x99t had a bunch of \xe2\x80\x9caccidents\xe2\x80\x9d I blamed on other people like you, just minor fender benders that were easily taken care of and everyone walked away with a laugh.  If anyone ever dare to lecture me like you chose to it will be lawsuit city.  \n\nWhat did you \xe2\x80\x9cspell out for me\xe2\x80\x9d.   That you think you\xe2\x80\x99re carmax becasue you live like a junkyard dog?  With a pile of rusted out trash in front of your trailer?  Yes you \xe2\x80\x9cspelled that out\xe2\x80\x9d for the whole world by being a braggart about something you should have kept to yourself.   \n\nYou should have some consideration for the victims you collided with.  I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you don\xe2\x80\x99t mind boss hog and goober telling you how to drive the glue truck but I\xe2\x80\x99m not you and you don\xe2\x80\x99t give me feckless little speeches.  Save it for the baptists and bar flys honey. '
b'I did reply to it nutsack and you didn\xe2\x80\x99t have to write a thesis.  Daft. \n\nDid you literally write some type of idiotic paragraph about me killing myself?  Wait because of you?  You think anyone would kill themselves? Anyone on this earth?  You are delusional. Bragging about some shitty junkyard then thinking someone cares about it.  Honestly.  What a shame.  Sloped forehead  and underbite.  \n\n'
b'So did that guy kill anyone or what? '
