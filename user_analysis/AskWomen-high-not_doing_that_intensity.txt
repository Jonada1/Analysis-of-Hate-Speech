b"I think so.  Trying to imprison someone's father to force them to marry you is pretty terrible.  If it's the live action, he actually tried to kill Maurice which is even more terrible.\n\n\nI don't know much about French justice then, but I'm pretty sure he was looking at death anyway he went.  I think he deserved it. "
b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou have a lot of willpower. I\xe2\x80\x99d kill myself if I had to deal with all that\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nCool, thanks for telling my you don\xe2\x80\x99t think my life is worth living because I\xe2\x80\x99m chronically ill. '
b'"What the fuck is this" "How the fuck did this happen" "How many fucking times" "What the fuck were you thinking" "Now I have to tell my fucking cousins and they\'re gonna kill you and then I\'m going to have to help dispose of the body and do you realize how upsetting that is for me"'
b'Men just use more violent means, Women attempt at a higher rate.  \n\n\nAnd speaking as someone who handles suicides, a lot of the reasons are stupid.  The most memorable ones are the child molesters that get caught, and kill themselves rather than "embarrass their names by going through the legal system"\n\n\nI\'m of a mixed opinion on this.  On the one hand, world\'s better off.  On the other, that\'s not really justice and a chance it won\'t grant the victims closure down the line.  Especially if it\'s kept hush hush and everyone goes on believing that the memory of that person is a good one and it was a tragic accident.  \n\n\nComplicated. '
b'Eragon and Funny People. Chunks of my life just gone for something that ironically made me want to kill myself. \n\n\nJust terrible. '
b"There's a lot of Trump supporters who could catch on fire and I would just be glad for the warmth \n\n\n\nEdit: lmao stay mad nazi scum \xf0\x9f\x92\x85\xf0\x9f\x8f\xbc"
b'Probably you trash panda \xf0\x9f\x98\x89'
b'I love when the trash takes itself out '
b'The women on both sides of my family age gracefully. In my experience it isn\xe2\x80\x99t true at all. \n\n\nAnd I guess it comes from shitty men and the beliefs that women after 30 are disgusting past their prime trash. \n\n\nLord knows I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen enough posts about it. '
b'Right? How scary is it that thinness is pushed so far as the standard of attractiveness people think I should be grateful my body is trying to kill itself??'
b'I\xe2\x80\x99m not naive enough to think that he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t find someone else that could love him as much as me and would probably be more beneficial as a partner than me, a disabled woman who spends her time with the dead while he\xe2\x80\x99s in politics. \n\n\nBut there\xe2\x80\x99s never going to be someone who fits better in his life than me. \n\n\nHis two best friends? Married to my two best friends. The mother of our godchildren I\xe2\x80\x99ve been friends with since I was 5 and before that our mothers were best friends in high school. \n\nWe\xe2\x80\x99ve been together since we were teens, I know him inside and out. His family loves me, my family adores him. \n\n\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t know if this mystery woman would be as supportive as me, but I\xe2\x80\x99m fairly confident it\xe2\x80\x99s unlikely she\xe2\x80\x99d offer to kill people and dispose of the bodies for him. \n\n\n\nI believe him when he says he loves me and he\xe2\x80\x99s done nothing to break my trust in 12 years, I take him at his word. '
b'I don\xe2\x80\x99t much care when people trash talk me, I tend to find it amusing actually. \n\n\nBut someone I care about? Welcome to becoming my mortal enemy where if you were on fire and I had a glass of water, I\xe2\x80\x99d drink it '
b'I tried to get one. Ex was stalking me. Following me when I was at work (delivery driver). No matter how much I blocked him he popped up. Threatened me. Threatened to kill himself. The works. \n\n\n\nPolice told me they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t issue one because he was going into the navy and they didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to mess up his military career before it began. And he\xe2\x80\x99d be gone soon, so couldn\xe2\x80\x99t I just suck it up?\n\n\n\nBasically, cops can get fucked with cacti. '
b'He says really absurd things to make me laugh.  Like when I\'m stressed about work he\'ll send me a gif of Vicky Valencourt holding a sign saying "Want me to kill them?" and it\'ll make me cackle. \n\n\nOther times if I ask he\'ll help me work through the problem.  He\'s just really supportive and there to give me whatever comfort I need'
b'Went to a National Park. People are fucking disgusting. Humans are trash. The world should just wipe us out already. Kill us off before we completely kill it. '
b'I would never do that. I have no interest in reading the private thoughts of others and if I found someone had done it to me I\xe2\x80\x99d probably kill them. \n\n\nWhich is a thought I regularly have so all mind readers around me already know the stakes if they get caught. '
b'Anyone can toss you aside like you\xe2\x80\x99re trash, familial ties are a lot less important than most want to believe. Especially if they are toxic '
b'Google lots of \xe2\x80\x9chow to kill someone and get away with it\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9ccan I take insurance out on a boyfriend\xe2\x80\x9d \n\n\nStuff like that '
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll kill myself\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\nMy response: \xe2\x80\x9cat least then you\xe2\x80\x99d leave me the fuck alone\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\nTeenage me was savage '
b'I\xe2\x80\x99m 31 with multiple autoimmune disorders. My body is trying to kill itself six ways from Sunday. \n\n\n\nIronically I look more attractive than I ever have in my life'
b'It\xe2\x80\x99s nothing to do with him and everything to do with me. \n\n\nHe\xe2\x80\x99s not going to make me cheat, it\xe2\x80\x99d be a decision I reached on my own. \n\n\n\nI never would, but it certainly isn\xe2\x80\x99t something he would force me into. \n\n\n\nAbuse? I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave. He cheats? My cousins will kill him. Really anything truly heinous and unforgivable would just make me leave, not bang someone else. '
b'Bro, so many many are so fucking dense they think a \xe2\x80\x9chi\xe2\x80\x9d and a smile means I want their dick. \n\n\nSounds like she was enjoying a convo and he had skeevy motives. So good riddance to the trash '
b'I don\xe2\x80\x99t let people treat me like trash and then blame it on a social construct like gender\n\n\n\n\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s no such thing as \xe2\x80\x9cmen\xe2\x80\x99s thing\xe2\x80\x9d to justify hurting someone. They need to take accountability for their actions ffs. That\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99re in this mess to begin with '
b'Me and the woman obviously fall in love, kill the men, and eat their corpses for survival'
b'I agree.  I find that people who claim "everyone\'s so sensitive these days! Culture is too PC!"  Are really just people upset they can\'t say sexist, abliest, racist, homophobic trash without being called out. '
