b'I\'ve waited tables off & on for 20 years & just left my last serving job a month ago.\n\nMy advice is appearance matters more than you\'d think so make sure you always look good, especially if you\'re a female. Put on make-up, fix your hair up (if its long enough) in a nice updo rather than a basic pontytail, iron your uniform or at least hang it up fresh out of the dryer so its not wrinkled, make sure your shoes are clean, no stains on your shirt, pants aren\'t faded. It sucks having to do all that if you\'re like me (basically a tomboy) but in my experience customers, especially men, tip more if you make an effort with your appearance. We had to wear these stupid bowties at my last job but corporate never specified a color so I went to 5 Below & stocked up on goofy looking ones. Customers liked that, I guess because buying my own bowties made it look like I gave a shit.\n\nSMILE. Make it look like you love your job & its the ONLY place you want be rather than the reality of wanting to burn it to the ground. Keep the customers\' drinks full if your restaurant offers free refills. Greet them as soon as they\'re seated & if that\'s not physically possible, hustle & get there as soon as you can. Know your menu like the back of your hand so you can answer any questions they have. Deliver their food as soon as it comes up before it gets a chance to cool down. Check on the table about 2 min after delivering the food & make sure they\'re happy with how everything tastes. Check on them a few times but don\'t hover. Apologize for any complaints they have & try to fix it even though its probably not your fault.\n\nAlways be nice even if they\'re being complete assholes. This part is really important because you get a lot of assholes. If the customer wants to make conversation with you & you\'re not busy asf, talk to them. Don\'t argue with them about politics, etc, just nod your head & agree with whatever bullshit they\'re spewing or they\'ll complain to management & fuck you on the tip. Never discuss tips with the customers unless they\'re foreign & ask you about the customary tip practices. DO NOT make comments to them about the tip amount they decide to leave you. Just smile & say thank you even if you\'re dying inside because they thought $5 was fair on a $100 check. Make sure you look busy at all times even if its slow because people get it in their heads that you don\'t deserve a decent tip if you\'re "just standing around" \xf0\x9f\x99\x84.\n\nI always made what\'s considered good money for my area & received numerous compliments. Hell, my last serving job was at a place that sells shakes & also steaks. Their prices are ridiculously low & the newish value menu really brought out the trash people so all of our tips dropped \xf0\x9f\x98\xa9. I still usually walked out with $80-$100 (plus my hourly) even on slower days. I made more before they introduced that goddamn value menu \xf0\x9f\x98\xa0. That\'s another thing. Avoid working at restaurants that have cheap prices because they draw in cheap ass customers. Places like that, people tend to leave only $2-$5 no matter what the bill is. At nicer, more expensive restaurants, people usually tip a percentage of the check & if the check is high your tip will be, too.'


b'It absolutely disgusts me that one customer/situation can absolutely screw over someone. Oh, 99% of the time you were amazing but this 1% time it lined up for you to get an insanely crazy person? \n\nLol nope, let\'s kill a employee\'s motivation to teach them a lesson, ignoring the fact that they\'ve been good up till this point.\n\nI worked at Wal-Mart once and was fired due to "no call no show". Problem was, I checked my schedule and didn\'t work the day I "skipped". So either I looked at my schedule wrong or my schedule was changed on me (which has happened to some employees before). Instead of going by my good track record; direct supervisor and long term employees liked me, showed up on time, was always doing what I could.\n\n They fired me, and another supervisor that I didn\'t work with much was in on the firing meeting. She told me I just wanted to skip even when I told my side of the story. Still pisses me off to this day because my word didn\'t matter, all that mattered was "Karen" thought I just wanted a free day off.'

b'I had a very similar situation happen to me.  It was not made secret that the DM and owner were actually going to fire me over it,  All over $10 worth of free food and ice cream.   Then they treated me like crap, reduced my hours, had someone steal from my till on evening shifts but was salty when I quit with no notice leaving them hurting during busy season.  The saddest thing about my situation was I\xe2\x80\x99d known everyone there since I was a kid, and they knew me to know how bizarre and untrue the complaint was.  I was dealing with some medical issues too and always gave 110% despite feeling like trash.  It definitely is a big hit to the morale.  '

b"I'm so happy to hear you just threw it away. That's absolutely bullshit that she just threw it down and walked away. If you just left it there, we assumed it was trash since you didn't tell us it was important. \xc2\xaf\\\\\\_(\xe3\x83\x84)_/\xc2\xaf"

b"There is one thing in this world that can kill me if I eat it, let's play a fun game of guess what it is."

b'I understand not wanting to let them get away with being assholes, but running after the dude was fucking dumb. Now I understand that in some places, bartenders or serving staff have to pay for the shit people skip out on, but doing shit like that is a good way to get hurt or killed. People do kill for far less.'

b'At least the tip was proper. Small place I work did 7200 in sales this past Saturday my ring was just over 1700 at the bar and I walked with 165. I am the head bartender and get tipped out from servers as well. That total was with everything tipped out. I am in the process of moving on from this shitshow of trash people. Like motherfucker I have worked for years to make you the \xe2\x80\x9cgreatest drink\xe2\x80\x9d you have ever had and you just tipped 3 dollars on a 72 dollar drink tab. Whole building of karens and donnys. '

b"I only make a big deal with the foods that can kill me, which is any kind of fish and sunflower seeds.   \nSalad bars scare me, because I have to ask if there are sunflower seeds in stuff. And they're usually right next to bacon bits, so that has to be done carefully.   \n\n\nOrdering fried chicken or other fried foods, I have to be specific that it not be cooked in the same fryer as catfish, shrimp, etc. Same thing with Hibachi grill.   \n"

b'\\---part 2---\n\n&#x200B;\n\nnow,...   everyone is screaming,  jocks-a-laughing,.   everyone is drenched in beer...  and mike slowly comes in..\n\n&#x200B;\n\nmike grabs the first 2 jocks he finds from behind by their belts.   he lifts them off their seats,  and slowly takes them out opening the door with their heads, and throws them outside screaming at the top of his lungs (i\'m romancing) YOU COME BACK,  I CRUSH YOU!\n\nmike comes back inside..  now the other jocks in there are getting ready for a fight.  mike doesn\'t give a shit..  he grabs the first 2 belts he finds..  these guys are weakly trying to fight,  mike doesn\'t give  shit.  he takes them out of the bar as well...   and he screams again, while the first 2 ones are getting up....\n\nYOU COME BACK,  I CRUSH YOU!!!  (bad translation again but you get the point).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMike gets back in.  his face looks like a pummeled apple but he doesn\'t give a shit.  he looks at the last pieces of trash in there..  and asks:  "you choose how you get out of here".\n\n&#x200B;\n\nthey all left.  (some of them even leaving backpacks and stuff in there)...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMike actually spent the rest of the evening drinking water and apologising about what happened to everyone...  he called for an all-around round for everyone.   he kept coming every now and then and was always acclaimed as a hero.\n\nfrom that day,  (and for the 6 months i was working there) the history got known...  and when fuckheads started trying to fuck shit up..  there were always ppl,  either regular or other jocks to tell them \'chill out..  you don\'T want Mike to take care of this\'.\n\nit even got so much known that waitresses were saying " don\'t do anything stupid,  you don\'t want me to call Mike in here".\n\n&#x200B;\n\ni wish i could find this guy again today,   just so i could thank him,  and hope he could still hug me and spin me like a princess.....\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT:   Mike never landed a punch or anything..  he just grabbed ppl by the belt while himself taking punches and threw ppl out.  i\'m pretty sure if he punched or hitted anyone it would have resulted in severe trauma for the reciever.  but that guy was just a passive \'don\'t fuck with my ppl\' type of guy.'

b"Its great when the trash takes itself out isn't it?"

b'I lean into This Bitch at the table.  \xe2\x80\x9cIs everything okay?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nDamn, that without context sounds like you were about to kill her. Even with context'

b'Did she at least take the diaper with her? \n\nUgh I had a table once who must have somehow changed the baby at the table without being noticed. Rather than getting up and tossing the diaper in the bathroom trash (the ladies room was 10 feet from their table AND had a separate changing room) they stuffed it in between the seat and the back of the booth for our busser. Good times.'
