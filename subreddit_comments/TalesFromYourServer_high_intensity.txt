b'Always always always always write stuff down, I can not stress this enough. \n\nPre bus the shit out of your tables. There shouldn\'t be anything on the table that they don\'t need immediately or in the near future. \n\nMark your tables. If they ordered steaks, make sure they have steak knifes etc etc. It\'s easy to forget stuff when it\'s busy. \n\nMore turns equals more tables equals more money.\n\nNo perfume, cologne, or scented lotions. Smell is a huge part of food and different smells can throw it off. \n\nOpen palms, never point with your finger. "where\'s the restroom?" *open palm* "that way bitch"\n\nGet rid of "you guys", "customer". Use ma\'am, sir, and guest/s.\n\nIf the table is excessively dirty don\'t be afraid to give it a quick wipe.\n\nLove your bussers, they will literally save your money.\n\nIf you need help, speak up! Ask for help! '
b"Never tolerate abuse from guests.  Physical, emotional, sexual, any of it.  If a guest is being abusive, you get a manager to handle it.  If the manager won't handle it, he's a terrible manager and you should start exploring your options."
b'When the kitchen (or you) messes up your tables order, apologize for the error and thank them for being patient while you correct it. if you grab a manager immediately and give them the cliff notes of what is going on, it makes you look more professional. drop the check off with a reassuring gratitude for their patience, they realize you fought for them in in a situation where they were wronged. humility, effort, and profesionalism will leave the guest feeling like they were a better person for sticking through the grimey bits. but if you\xe2\x80\x99re table IS rude about it, still do the apology and appreciation  portion, but don\xe2\x80\x99t suck their dick. you\xe2\x80\x99re nobody\xe2\x80\x99s bitch. some people are just bitter. '
b'This is my favorite customer service tip: most people like to say "yes". Learn to ask questions so that the "yes" answer makes your job easier.  Example: it\'s towards the end of the meal, and the customers sodas are low. If you ask if they\'d like refills, most people are going to say yes, because they\'re free and they don\'t care. However, quite often, if you ask them " have you had enough soda?", they will also answer yes, and that saves you time and product. \nI work in a breakfast place, and I always ask "are hash browns fine for you" instead of listing the options when I\'m very busy. \nIt takes a little bit of practice to come up with different ways to word your questions but it\'s been a hell of a time saver for me over the years. \n\nAlso, when a customer is being an asshole to you, it\'s very important to remember that it is almost never about you, and that they are a person who is in pain or misery. It\'s very hard to make good tips when you are angry, so try to be compassionate instead. It may not always turn the situation around, but it does help prevent them from screwing with your concentration and income. \n'
b"I shared some of the same tips in another thread but I think this will be helpful to any new starters;\n\n1)Do not share your personal life, issues, drama, views on politics etc with your coworkers as it will go around, people gossip A LOT in this industry. \n\n2)Always be on friendly terms with your team, including bar, chefs etc. This is your second family so treat them like it. Also, you never know who knows who and industry isn't exactly stable. And for the love of god don't start hooking up with people at work or customers. That's incredibly unprofessional and stupid. Don't start drama ever. You will see these people for like 40 hrs every week it's not worth it. \n\n3)Save your money, you never know when you'll hit a dead period like January etc and your hours will be decreased. \n\n4)Invest into a really good pair of shoes, go to a specialist, you don't need fashionable shoes but you need really comfortable shoes because you will be working 12 hrs straight and your feet will thank you for putting them in comfortable, supportive shoes. \n\n5)Always have lots of pens, chewing gum, mouthwash, deodorant, hairbrush in your bag when you go to work. Always iron your clothes and look the best you can every single day you're there. Your looks and hygiene matter\n\n6)Learn your entire menu off by heart, drinks, and food. Know where the food comes from, how it's prepared, know every ingredient, how the sauces are made, learn about wine and beer pairings. Taste everything. Talk to the kitchen they will be happy to tell you all about it. Also learn about your brand, the history and what they stand for. \n\n7)Always smile, even when you're stressed.\n\n8)Always address your customers - sir/madam. No matter where you work it's really to have excellent language. \n\n9)Bring a little snack with you or a sugary drink, or just a chocolate bar to keep your energy levels`up.\n\n10)Talk to senior waiters, ask them for help, ask them to show you how to do things. They will be happy to help you if you're eager to learn. For example: how to carry 3 or 4 plates in your hands. \n\n11)After you take an order read it back completely EVEN SMALL ORDERS! Believe me, it sucks when you hear one thing and they said something else.  \n\n12)Do not let your customers run you. This is your restaurant. You control it and you run it. Do not take any abuse or commands. For example, if they are placed on this table and table plan is complete this means this is their table and they cannot sit by the window and have these more comfortable seats. If they have booked to have a table for 2 hours, this means they have this table for only 2 hours. What I'm trying to say is that people think being a waiter is easy and that you're an uneducated moron. Often people have no respect for you as you're JUST a waiter. Do not take any shit from anyone. \n\nThis is an extremely stressful and hard job and you should be proud of it. \n"
b'1)Make sure to have a good relationship with the Chef even if they have a big mouth and a temper. If you learn how to be their favorite member of staff,  you\'ll avoid a LOT of hassle in the future and during peak times. \n\n\n2) learn the "dead inside nothing can surprise me anymore " smile quickly.  \n\n3) you are not saving lives.  Keep a cool head and take it like a show where you\'re on stage.  Find the fun. \n\n4) if you start a shift by remembering that for some mysterious reason, customers seem to lose half of their brain functions when they cross the restaurant threshold,  nothing will be able to shake your confidence.  \n\n5) kill them with kindness.  \n\n6) a good prep is key for a nice shift.  Keep your pens with you at all times.  \n'
b'If you have to say no to a guest, always give them alternatives.  Don\'t just say "We can\'t do that".  For example:\n\n"I\'m sorry but we are out of the riesling.  Would you like to try the pinot grigio or sauvignon blanc instead?"\n\n"We unfortunately are out of the ribeye, however our new york strip is also a great steak if you\'re hungry."\n\n"We do have a thirty minute wait for a table, however you\'re more than welcome to grab a drink at the bar while you wait."'
b'Smiling goes a long way, smile at the end of your statements and you will get better reactions. Smile when you speak on the phone it makes your voice sound more positive. \n\nRehearse your spiel. I personally hate the \xe2\x80\x9cMy name is beefsinajar and I\xe2\x80\x99ll be taking care of you today\xe2\x80\x9d. I like to ask guests if they have dined with us before and then either thank them for returning or welcome them with a brief description of our menus. I also always try to save the step of telling them my name after we\xe2\x80\x99ve already chatted a bit, it helps them remember, and some guests love to use your name. \n\nAlso I don\xe2\x80\x99t like when servers refer to tables as \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x9d such as \xe2\x80\x9care we ready to order?\xe2\x80\x9d I think it sounds belittling so I say \xe2\x80\x9care y\xe2\x80\x99all ready to order\xe2\x80\x9d (I am in the south)\n\nLearn the menu! Study the menu! Be informed about allergies as it pertains to the menu. It\xe2\x80\x99s okay to check with the kitchen but having a good baseline of what\xe2\x80\x99s gluten free, vegan etc helps you save time in the long run. \n\nAnd my final word of advice: Be nice to the dishwasher. I know a lot of folks have said be nice to your coworkers, bussers, cooks etc and that is true. But dishwashers generally have the worst job and often make the lowest salary. Just be nice to them and it will boost your tip karma. '
b'So much good stuff here already, but here\'s mine: **Never hold tickets.** Putting them in the system should always be priority No. 1.\n\nYou\'re totally slammed, so you think you\'ll be able to better pace yourself if you take the orders, but just hold off ordering food for one or two of your tables. The next thing you know you\'ve got a six-dumpster fire going on - and it won\'t go away any time soon because now tables that thought they ordered their food 20 minutes ago are realizing that no food is showing up.\n\n"Weeded with food to deliver" > "Weeded with NO food to deliver" any day.'
b'DONT use a generic spiel. Have something different to say for each table. If you go up to one table and say a spiel and then go to the next table and say the same one, chances are the tables could hear you say the same thing. It lessens the genuine feel of your service. \nExample: \nTo table 1: \xe2\x80\x9chey how is everyone doing today? Can I get everyone started with something to drink...\xe2\x80\x9d\nTo table 2: \xe2\x80\x9chey I hope everyone is doing well thank you for joining us. What would you like to drink today/tonight?\xe2\x80\x9d \nTable 3: \xe2\x80\x9cgood morning/afternoon/evening everyone. I\xe2\x80\x99ll be taking care of you. What drinks can I grab for you to start?\xe2\x80\x9d '
b'Ok well, i will just list my advice on here. i typed something out the other day and accidentally exited the page.\n\n1. Always make sure you have a steady supply of pens on you. Fill your whole right side of your apron up with pens. You will have a lot of pens, but its a lot better than walking in the door, clocking in, and realizing that you have NONE!\n2. Get a small, thin wallet and use it to hold your bank, if your restaurant requires you to have one. (meaning you don\'t use a cash register each time you make change for guests.) Keep this in the left side of your apron, unless you are left handed, then your pen side and wallet side will swap. Because honestly it is a pain in the butt trying to get change for somebody when you are in the weeds!\n3. Speaking of change, i keep a pocket full of change in my right pocket. About 8 quarters, 8 nickels, 10 dimes, and some pennies. Its either that, or you round UP and give them a dollar. I don\'t care if their coin-change is one cent, you\'re rounding up. Again, i keep an excessive amount of coins on me just incase. \n4. Try to purchase at least a weeks-worth of shift\'s company t-shirts. Most places will have you pay for extra shirts outside from what they give you to start off with. This way you always have a clean shirt. I used to have only 3 shirts and was doing laundry every 3 workdays. Which is a pain in the ass. When you DO clean your workshirts, make sure you throw your apron in there too. sans pens.\n5. Speaking of cleaning things, depending where you work your shoes can get HELLA dirty. I have a wash cloth that i keep under the bathroom sink, i just take the end of it, put some water on it, and wipe off any of the crumbs and junk that get on there before i leave for work. I like to look good, thanks. \n6. And speaking of shoes, invest in some decent work shoes will ya. I know a lot of people at my work use [shoesforcews.com](https://shoesforcews.com) but personally i just get mine at payless. Slip resistant is mandatory. And if your feet hurt after work, invest in some Dr. Scholle\'s inserts. Your feet will thank you, and you will be more productive, so your wallet will thank you too.\n7. And speaking of feet, wear crew socks. Don\'t wear ankle socks. Unless you know for a fact the ones you have won\'t go riding down your foot. I am allowed to wear capris at my work, so i wanted some ankle socks, and they ended up being a bother. \n8. Now that we\'re done with the bare basics, here is some advice to make good money:\n9. Always come in to work with a positive attitude. You really have to learn to leave shit at the door, and focus on your job. I think of work as my escape from home life, and home life as my escape from work. \n10. Learn your menu inside and out. When someone asks a random question that you don\'t know the answer to, go ask the chef, and keep it as a mental note for the next time someone asks you. This is how you know for future reference and makes you look professional in the long run. The more knowledgable you are overall, the more you will be tipped. It shows the guest you aren\'t just someone working a temporary gig, but that you care about your job. This isn\'t just about menu items. How are they made? Are they steamed, boiled, broiled, baked? Where is your meat sourced from? Are they grass fed? These are things you aren\'t taught in training. Also, if management sees you taking a keen interest, well, they remember that type of thing. Again this might just be a side gig until you graduate college, but why not put your all in to it while you\'re on the clock? There\'s no reason not to. IT MEANS MORE MONEY.\n11. ALWAYS CHECK ID\'S AS PER YOUR COMPANY\'S POLICY. If someone appears under 40, check their ID. Check the picture, the birthdate, and the expiration date. Try to get quick at locating all of these features. When asking for ID, its best practice to hold out your hand, so you can hold it while you inspect it. If someone give you an attitude for it, who cares. I usually ignore comments like "oh my god they\'re checking my ID! Can you believe it?!" or "Wow i dont look 21?!" I don\'t react, i just stand there and wait. If you feel like you have to justify yourself, just say "We have (insert your state\'s alcohol board name) doing stings right now." \n12. Always be doing something. Always. There is always something to do, unless the place just opened and no one is there yet. Fill the ice bins. Fill the cup containers. Fill the to-go supplies. Lemons. butters. plates. bevnaps. straws. Run salads apps and food. ask the bar if they need anything when you are over there waiting for your drinks. If you see a task, do it. '
b'Don\xe2\x80\x99t watch your co-workers balance a zillion plates on  their arms and feel like you\xe2\x80\x99ll never be able to do it. Practice at home and grow confidence. You\xe2\x80\x99ll get there! \n\nPlacing a napkin under a soup bowl or any other serve ware will prevent accidents if this is not a policy your restaurant already has in place.  \n\nNEVER hold a glass near the top, but only the bottom (this is probably too obvious, but I\xe2\x80\x99m saying it anyways).\n\nTreat every table like they are gonna tip you $100 and don\xe2\x80\x99t stereotype anyone. \n\nNo matter where you work, act as though you are working in a fine dining establishment. Take ladies\xe2\x80\x99 orders first, serve from the right, etc. Many times, it might be lost on the patrons, but it\xe2\x80\x99s a good practice, and there are patrons who notice even if you are not working in an upscale place. \n\n Be a team player. Lend a hand to your fellow servers, but also be kind to the BOH. They have the ability to save your ass in the most dire of times!  \n\nMost importantly, love your job and act like it. Up-sell. UP-SELL!'
b'This is super long but... I always give this advice! \n\n1.) There will always, always, always be difficult customers. It\'s not you, ITS THEM. So respond with a big ole grin and charm... even when they\'re being nothing but outrageous/rude/extra/cheap, etc. \\*Letting customers get to you is mentally draining (something I seriously had to learn the hard way.)\xc2\xa0Let it roll off at the end of your shift. Leave that shit at work. \n\n2.) If you get stiffed, it\'s okay. It happens. It\'s rare (depending upon the restaurant) but it DOES happen. Take it in stride as well... because for every shitty cheap ass table there\'s three more good ones behind it.\xc2\xa0\n\n3.) Try to pick up on the vibe of the table. This will come with experience... if someone seems talkative or like they wanna converse, by all means-- find something you have in common, compliment them to open up discussion or have a light-hearted feel, and even joke with them if you feel laid back and comfortable enough with the table. If it\'s a business meeting or they look serious/solemn DO not try to repeatedly talk to them-- they\'ll just get irritated if they\'re busy. Think of how you\'d want to be treated at a restaurant and then respond accordingly.\xc2\xa0\n\n4.) Build. your. regulars. Regular clientele make up for SO much of a restaurants business. Learn their orders. Learn their drink preference. Remember details about their life and ask them. It makes such a difference. In your tip, in your work mood.. everything. Plus this is also how you find connections. (I\'ve waited on an LSAT instructor for law school, a mentor/paralegal that specializes in the type of law I want to go into, car mechanics, beauty artists, tattoo artists.... people that will seriously hook you up because you help them and treat them with such good service.)\xc2\xa0\n\n5.) Work in front of your tables. Clean. Help your fellow servers. Stock. It looks good. Don\'t stand around on your phone or converse for too long with co-workers... it leaves a table wondering "where\'s my salad/appetizer?" "Does she notice my drink is low?"\xc2\xa0Plus it\'s just like... the decent thing to do??? You\'re there to make money, not scroll through Twitter. \n\n6.) Speaking of which: prepare/anticipate. Sweet tea/un-sweet tea? Bring extra ice and ask about lemons/limes/oranges. It looks really professional. Ordered an appetizer? Ask about the need for specific condiments and ALWAYS bring app plates and napkins. If you have a big party, go ahead and bring Mayo, mustard, and ketchup to the table-- as well as some ranch, honey mustard, etc. I did that tonight on one of my parties and it made all of the difference. It\'s the little things!\n\n7.) I cannot say this enough: pre-bus, pre-bus, pre-bus. Not only does it help the hosts (and turns the tables over faster, thus ensuring you more money) but it LOOKS SO MUCH MORE PROFESSIONAL. I always jokingly say "can I get these plates out of your way?! Don\'t want you to have to chill/hang out with dirty dishes!" And then ask if they\'d like a box/to go drink or anything (if they are reluctant when you ask to make some room by getting shit out of the way.)\n\n8.) I do this sometimes, not always... but write a little note on the receipt. Like "thanks so much :)" or "have a great night." It\'s just a little cute detail that may help boost your tips. Also: I do this if the table seems friendly and has been on a first name basis with you all night-- when you deliver their card back, state the name on it.. like "thanks john. Hope you all have a wonderful night!" Etc... you get the point.\xc2\xa0\n\n9.) State your name in the introduction... and when you gather menus reiterate your name and say "okay and again I\'m \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_, let me know if there\'s anything I can do for you at all, I\'ll get this food workin\' for ya!" That way your table isn\'t snapping at you or waving their hands or being all like "ummmm server, server!" As if you don\'t have a name :-)\xc2\xa0\n\n10.) Learn. the. menu. Take home a menu and study it, quiz yourself... alcohol will be the hardest part if you\'re new to serving and don\'t know much about it. Learn the basic & easy stuff like draft and bottled beers, house wine/liquors, etc. memorize your happy hours/specials. Write them on the inside of your server book as a cheat sheet if need be.\xc2\xa0\n\n11.) Get the manager if things escalate. If someone seems too drunk or off, grab a manager. If someone has a specific allergy or request, grab a manager. Always consult with management. And if the table is still not happy, pull a manager over towards the end of the meal and see what all you can do (discount, store credit, dessert on the restaurant) to ensure that they come back and leave happy. Don\'t be afraid to ask for help if you dont know something or if you feel that a situation at a table has escalated too far! I\'ve even had managers take over and SERVE or kick out tables that were too creepy, drunk, or outright rude. \n\n12.) Don\'t judge a book by its cover! Don\'t stereotype. Treat everyone the way you would like to be treated. :) \n\nHope this helps! '
b'Don\'t spoil your potential regulars too quickly! If you do, they\'ll just want more and more and more... Also, find a way to (subtly) let them know that a favour (no matter how big or small) is actually just that. If you\'re too "That\'s no problem!" about it all the time it\'ll come back to bite you and you\'ll end up in this vicious cycle of finding it impossible to please them.'
b"tips beyond just a standard polite amount are all about being seen as a human being.\n\nUnless the place you work is too formal for this (in which case you probably don't need advice lol) just seriously engage with your tables and make them like you. Talk to them like you're having a brief conversation when you stop by. Laugh with them when they're being goofy. Enjoy the experience with them. Know when to be brief (once they have their food especially), and when to give them a minute of your time. You're not their robot Butler. Break the 4th wall a little bit. Smile.\n\n\nYou'll rake in money, I promise. People love love love happy, engaged service. "
b'The best advice I ever got as a new server was, \xe2\x80\x9cStop and take a deep breath. It\xe2\x80\x99s just food, not brain surgery. Nobody\xe2\x80\x99s gonna die here today.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNo matter how weeded and stressed out you get, take 10 seconds and just breathe for a bit. That will help you calm down, gather your thoughts, and prioritize your tasks. The few seconds it takes will seem like forever at the time, but the time you gain by calming down more than makes up for it. And don\xe2\x80\x99t let that lady on table 25 get to you. Sure, she NEEDS lemon for her Diet Coke and you forgot it, but she\xe2\x80\x99s not gonna die if she has to wait a minute for it. Perspective is everything. You got this. '
b'I\xe2\x80\x99m definitely coming back to read the whole thread but wanted to throw some things out there (sorry if they are repeats)\n\nCheck all of your tables when you are on the floor - the less trips you make, the better. Plus guests will flag you if they need you, and you can ask if they want refills or take empty dishes. \n\nWithin 2 minutes ask your guests about their food \xe2\x80\x94 but never use the word \xe2\x80\x9cgood\xe2\x80\x9d. Ask them if the meat is cooked perfectly or if everything is delicious or amazing. \n\nGreet within 60 sec, with your name and a smile. \n\nSmile. And be friendly. No one wants to go out to dinner and be served by a grouch. They go to escape or have a break from life\xe2\x80\x99s crap. If you\xe2\x80\x99re grumpy, it will ruin their experience and obviously affect any tips (or ordering dessert/drinks). \n\nRead your guests. An easy way is to aSk what brought them out to dinner \xe2\x80\x94 and then make a big deal and celebrate WITH them. Dad\xe2\x80\x99s birthday? He is now \xe2\x80\x9cbirthday boy\xe2\x80\x9d. Wedding anniversary? Awesome! How many years?? If your establishment offers free desserts or whatever, congratulate them and tell them we love to celebrate with them \xe2\x80\x94 and dessert is on us tonight :) or ask if they want to celebrate with a bottle of wine or champagne (and know the wines you sell, highlighting a red and white).\n\nWhen you see the table finishing up, prep their check. Most tables will decline dessert, asking for the check \xe2\x80\x94 and are impressed when you give it to them right then. \n\nRelate to them somehow. Coo over the babies, talk to the kiddos. Share your own life experiences (briefly ofc). \n\nDo your side work as early as possible. \n\nHelp everyone. The whole restaurant is your table. \n\nAfter they order, repeat back and ask if they would like to start with soup or salad. \n\nAfter getting whole table orders, offer something shareable during dinner (for me it\xe2\x80\x99s our signature cornbread). Or after dinner, offer a shareable dessert. Often times no one will order a full dessert but wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t mind a few bites of something for the whole table. \n\nRun everyone\xe2\x80\x99s food. Box things for them. Pull empty dishes off their tables. Ask their guests if they want a refill and then get it for them. You are a TEAM; if you don\xe2\x80\x99t work like one, you end up getting shafted same as everyone else. If you DO, it\xe2\x80\x99s a well oiled machine. Plus karma comes back around. \n\nClean up after them every time you pass the table. No one likes eating amidst a mess. \n\nUltimately, think of the absolute BEST time you went to dinner and how the service was. Like, when you wanted to tell the manager how good they were, or told your dinner mate that you needed to go back there again soon just because of the server. I\xe2\x80\x99m working my dream job and it was because our first server was amazing \xe2\x80\x94 she trained me too \xf0\x9f\x98\x82. '
b'Been doing this for a while so I\xe2\x80\x99m just gonna throw a bunch out there\n\n\n-Try to read people. Some people need a lot of attention from servers and want you to be there before they need something and others just want you to leave them alone. Try to figure out what people want from you as their server\n-Try to put less ice in kids drinks because I promise you they will guzzle that shit down in a matter of seconds. \n-try try try with all your might to fix any problems before bringing it to management. They have enough to deal with and of course they\xe2\x80\x99re happy to help but if you can do it alone yourself, that\xe2\x80\x99s a great sign of being self sufficient and it looks way better to management and to your tables. Take responsibility and do your best.\n-slow Down and make sure everything is rang in correctly. If you take those few extra seconds to make sure it\xe2\x80\x99s right, you won\xe2\x80\x99t have to fix it later\n-honestly if you just do everything right the first time, (obviously we make mistakes of course) you won\xe2\x80\x99t have to fix it later. This goes for side work too. Don\xe2\x80\x99t slack off and half-ass it, you\xe2\x80\x99ll just be stuck either having to redo it later or left with no silverware and stressed.\n-try to give people the benefit of the doubt and realize that everyone has bad days and some customers may unfortunately take it out on you. That\xe2\x80\x99s never okay to do, but some people don\xe2\x80\x99t know how to deal with it and you have to be the bigger person and just get over it (or vent about it here)\n-relax, it\xe2\x80\x99s not that hard of a job. You\xe2\x80\x99ll be fine, everything will be okay. '
b'1- your job will be much easier if you remain in the good graces of those upon whom your work depends. Be very respectful towards bussers, hosts, dish tank workers, food runners, bartenders, and whoever else works in the front of house. Don\xe2\x80\x99t see any other position in the stores as beneath yours.\n\n2- going along with that, try to see things from the side of your cooks. They have a lot to keep in mind; simple courtesies like \xe2\x80\x9cchef, may I call?\xe2\x80\x9d go a very long way. \n\n3- as regards all customers: simply smile and take their money.'
b"When possible, don't pay attention to your tips from individual tables until the end of the shift.\n\nAssuming a table won't tip well is a self-fulfilling prophecy; give everyone the same level of service.\n\nTrack your tips and hours, TipSee is a good app for this.  It's easy to fool yourself into thinking you're making more or less than what you actually do.  \n\nDon't plan on making good money every shift.  Save money whenever you can.  Put most or all of it straight into the bank.  Cash disappears, especially when going out for drinks after a shift.\n\nAccept your coworkers for what they are.  They will never start doing his running sidework efficiently no matter how pissed off you are that he never fills the ice bin or takes the bus tub of dishes to the back of the house.  Learn what they are good at and appreciate them for that.\n\nGive your place of employment a chance to prove it's a good place to work, but don't hesitate to move on from a bad situation.  There are far too many shitty owners and managers in the business, and plenty of fantastic ones too.  Money isn't everything, a good work environment where you make 90% as much money will leave you in a better place emotionally and physically, which often translates to a better financial place even with a little less income.\n\n"
b'Always keep track of how much money you\xe2\x80\x99re making & don\xe2\x80\x99t get discouraged until the end of the week. I usually am satisfied if I average $100 a shift (I\xe2\x80\x99m a college student fortunate enough to have parents who pay for a lot of my necessities so your goal could be higher based on your monthly bills). I work a set schedule of four shifts a week meaning I need to make $400 a week. This also means I could\nmake $50 one night, $100 the next, $150, & then $100. $50 feels really shitty but if you\xe2\x80\x99re making your goal by the end of the week then it\xe2\x80\x99s a lot easier to walk with your $50 without feeling discouraged. \n\nAlso, the night always ends. So even when you\xe2\x80\x99re getting your ass kicked & you want to walk out, just remember the night will be over & probably a lot sooner than you think it will. '
b'Take food allergies and dietary restrictions seriously. \n\nDevelop a key for yourself to differentiate between diet sodas and regular. (For example, I have a large party with lots of colas and only one or two diet colas, I put two straws in their drink instead of one.) Restate their drink as you set it down. \xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s your diet cola!\xe2\x80\x9d That sort of thing. \n\nIf you\xe2\x80\x99re not sure if an allergen is hiding in a dish, check with the cooks or Chef. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not sure if there\xe2\x80\x99s garlic in the paprikash, but I can check!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t start a conversation with or ask a question of fellow servers while they\xe2\x80\x99re ringing in an order. Some people are good at multitasking and some people are not. It\xe2\x80\x99s best to assume they can\xe2\x80\x99t split their focus in this situation and making sure the order goes in correctly is the priority. \n\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t skimp on your side work. You may get out 20 minutes earlier, but your coworkers will resent you. You need to make friends, not enemies. '
b"Hey new servers! I've been serving for 12 years at different places from fine dining to a comedy club and the most underrated advice is to take care of the people that take care of you.\nThis goes from the lowly busser who cleans your tables quicker because they like you better all the way up to the asshole cooks (jk love you guys) that yell at you when they have to get a dish out on the fly because you forgot to ring it in.\nBuy the kitchen a 12 pack and they'll still yell at you for forgetting that burger but you better bet it'll come out fast. Also for the kitchen; when you are slammed waiting on food to come out ask every person on the line if you can go grab them something to drink. The line is a million degrees and they are stuck there for hours sweating! A couple waters or lemonades takes a minute and they'll love you. \nThe hosts can litterally decide if you get triple sat with ratchets or evenly sat with regulars who tip fat. They also love candy, starbucks and a little light flirting. \nThe bussers are the easiest to keep happy. An extra $5 or a monster for keeping your section looking good goes a long way. Also, buy their pot or whatever they push. \nManagement: don't kiss their ass, bust yours. They'll notice. \nMost of all remember that you are a team and if one of you falls they bring the whole team down. \n"
b'As a former boy scout, my motto for new servers is "be prepared".\n\nSeriously, be prepared.\n\nWhat\'s in my apron?\n\nZebra Z grip pens. Best out there. Metal clips that never break. Black ink.\n\nBic lighter\n\nCrumber... yeah my job requires one.\n\n\nA hinged wine key. This is a personal preference regarding the " hinge".  For years, I refused to roll with my old school wine key. \n\nShoes: Doc Martens. \n\nEdit: the shoes were not in my apron\n'
b'Okay I\'m going to jump in with one of my favorite tricks. This works especially well when being double triple or quadruple sat. I treat my section as one big table. I try to keep their steps of service all on the same rhythm, such as getting all their drinks out at once. This obviously does not work all the time and the Rhythm can easily be tripped up but it\'s a good goal.\n\nAlso I\'m going to say a very important tip would be to stay out of the drama and fly under the radar. Restaurants are notorious for drama and politics. Do not join in this! I repeat, do not join in this! Hoping you\'re assertive enough to even make a statement such as " I stay out of stuff like that" and believe it or not people will stop trying to include you in that drama.'
b"Smile and be friendly A LOT. A good attitude can turn a bad situation into a great one. I've gotten AMAZING tips from people who got hair in their food, because I was able to keep smiling and happy (read: dying inside) through it all. Also just being generally friendly, smiley, and talkative will tend to get you better tips in general. "
b"Have a good closing statement- this is when customers have tips on their minds. I use 'it was lovely to serve you all this evening' or ' it was wonderful to have you all dine with us (or join us for dinner) a lovely rest of your evening.' Using wording like this instead of a standard 'thank you' helps with tips. \n\nKeep calm. It's hard to do much of the time. Figure out how to keep yourself calm and in the zone!\n\nOne of the perks of this industry is that we can express our frustrations with customers or how the shift is going! Many jobs do not have this luxury- use it. If you are pissed off about what is happening on the floor express it in the back where no customers can hear you. It is a great way to relieve stress and can strengthen that sense of comradery with coworkers. Don't over do it of course. No one wants to be know as the complainer. \n\nAccept that you are going to see people acting completely ridiculous and that it is out of your control.  Customers can be more entitled or pissy than you would imagine. If you ever feel as if you may lose it walk away and tell your manager. This industry can be rough and some days are much worse than others.  A good manager will understand when someone has reached their breaking point. \n\nOh and eat before your shift aka don't run on fumes. "
b'I\'ve waited tables off & on for 20 years & just left my last serving job a month ago.\n\nMy advice is appearance matters more than you\'d think so make sure you always look good, especially if you\'re a female. Put on make-up, fix your hair up (if its long enough) in a nice updo rather than a basic pontytail, iron your uniform or at least hang it up fresh out of the dryer so its not wrinkled, make sure your shoes are clean, no stains on your shirt, pants aren\'t faded. It sucks having to do all that if you\'re like me (basically a tomboy) but in my experience customers, especially men, tip more if you make an effort with your appearance. We had to wear these stupid bowties at my last job but corporate never specified a color so I went to 5 Below & stocked up on goofy looking ones. Customers liked that, I guess because buying my own bowties made it look like I gave a shit.\n\nSMILE. Make it look like you love your job & its the ONLY place you want be rather than the reality of wanting to burn it to the ground. Keep the customers\' drinks full if your restaurant offers free refills. Greet them as soon as they\'re seated & if that\'s not physically possible, hustle & get there as soon as you can. Know your menu like the back of your hand so you can answer any questions they have. Deliver their food as soon as it comes up before it gets a chance to cool down. Check on the table about 2 min after delivering the food & make sure they\'re happy with how everything tastes. Check on them a few times but don\'t hover. Apologize for any complaints they have & try to fix it even though its probably not your fault.\n\nAlways be nice even if they\'re being complete assholes. This part is really important because you get a lot of assholes. If the customer wants to make conversation with you & you\'re not busy asf, talk to them. Don\'t argue with them about politics, etc, just nod your head & agree with whatever bullshit they\'re spewing or they\'ll complain to management & fuck you on the tip. Never discuss tips with the customers unless they\'re foreign & ask you about the customary tip practices. DO NOT make comments to them about the tip amount they decide to leave you. Just smile & say thank you even if you\'re dying inside because they thought $5 was fair on a $100 check. Make sure you look busy at all times even if its slow because people get it in their heads that you don\'t deserve a decent tip if you\'re "just standing around" \xf0\x9f\x99\x84.\n\nI always made what\'s considered good money for my area & received numerous compliments. Hell, my last serving job was at a place that sells shakes & also steaks. Their prices are ridiculously low & the newish value menu really brought out the trash people so all of our tips dropped \xf0\x9f\x98\xa9. I still usually walked out with $80-$100 (plus my hourly) even on slower days. I made more before they introduced that goddamn value menu \xf0\x9f\x98\xa0. That\'s another thing. Avoid working at restaurants that have cheap prices because they draw in cheap ass customers. Places like that, people tend to leave only $2-$5 no matter what the bill is. At nicer, more expensive restaurants, people usually tip a percentage of the check & if the check is high your tip will be, too.'
b'- Work hard to provide value to your table. The money will come if they don\xe2\x80\x99t think you\xe2\x80\x99re in it just for the money..\n- All movements should be with a purpose and time-efficient. \n- Help your coworkers, you never know when you\xe2\x80\x99ll need something, and they WON\xe2\x80\x99T forget the one time you didn\xe2\x80\x99t grab them a ranch when they got triple sat 5 months and 2 days ago. \n- Be different. Don\xe2\x80\x99t seem like you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be there and don\xe2\x80\x99t be the extremely ecstatic person. Lots of people aren\xe2\x80\x99t fans of the extremely over the top, happy-go-lucky server. It seems fake and forced. Talk to them like you know them, like they\xe2\x80\x99re your but in a professional way. \n- Don\xe2\x80\x99t let them see you being lazy or doing nothing. You might not think they\xe2\x80\x99re watching, but if their drinks are 1/4 full and they see that you\xe2\x80\x99ve been at the POS talking for the last 4 minutes, they\xe2\x80\x99ll take note. Trust that. \n- FAMILIARIZE YOURSELF WITH THE MENU. If you don\xe2\x80\x99t know the alcohols, the cuts of meat, the amount of sides, the sides, etc..... no bueno. It may seem silly and like a little thing, but I promise you it\xe2\x80\x99s not. \n- DON\xe2\x80\x99T HOVER!!! I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure if people dislike hovering servers or neglectful servers more. In General, it should go like something like this: \n1) Greet, drinks, and apps \n2) Deliver drinks, ask if they\xe2\x80\x99re ready to order or if they need a few more minutes. If they have any questions, tell them feel free to ask. \n3) Take orders\n4) Food comes out. Two bites or two minutes, ask if it came out alright and if it\xe2\x80\x99s tasting ok. \n5) Be check ready. Ask if they need boxes when they\xe2\x80\x99re slowing down, and deliver the check prior to them being done to get the table flipped. \n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s an easy job if you care about the people you\xe2\x80\x99re serving and understand that there will be good and bad tables every day. Don\xe2\x80\x99t be that annoying coworker that cries about every bad tip and tells everyone about your $15 tip. No one cares.\n\nGood luck!'
b'Talk to your tables. I\'m the head bartender at a spot where I never get regulars but take tables as well as work the bar. \n\nYou can be the best server in the world, but if you don\'t win a mean table over it won\'t matter. \n\nWe\'ve all been there, you\'ve got 10 tables and you\'re ahead of the game, smiling, killing it, and the runners drop a tray, or the kitchen didn\'t read "no jalepenos," or the bartender lost your ticket. \nJust talk to your tables. \n\n10 minutes feels like an hour when you\'re waiting on something. Entertain your guests. Especially if you\'re a bartender. Tell them what\'s going on. I\'ve noticed more and more people have food service experience in this age, so just tell them its busy and the kitchen is behind. Be honest, apologize, and then entertain them. People like to be included. '
b"I'm having trouble knowing what to prioritize first. If I get triple sat, do I get all their drink orders then make them all wait? Do I do one a at a time? Do I get someones check or someone a refill first? Or do I gauge by customer. I hate being late and making people wait stresses me out, so I get a little flustered, but overall I think I'm pretty efficient. Any advice you have learned from experience would be very helpful :)"
b"I served for 6 months at one restaurant, and it was my first serving job. \n\n\nI've been training at my new job and tomorrow I start making tips... But I'm SO freaking anxious! Do y'all get like that when you start a new serving job? I've been panicking completely. Like I've never waited a table before lol. I dunno how to calm the fuck down. "
b'Can anyone tell me how to get a job as a server with no experience? I have customer service experience but no restaurant. Should I just walk in with my resume and ask if they\xe2\x80\x99re hiring? Should I not take my resume? Do I tell them I have no serving experience but am ready and willing to learn, and also that I\xe2\x80\x99m a fast learner? Also is it better to work at like a family owned Coney Island or a chain restaurant?'
b'Our restaurant (like most places) has a very high turn over rate. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been working here for 3.5 years, and we\xe2\x80\x99re honestly consistently busy. Out side of our chain specific rules their are three things I like to teach and tell new servers. \n\n1. Treat your section as your own mini business. The faster you flip your section, the more money potential you have. Be Efficient, be quick.\n\n2. It\xe2\x80\x99s easy to get overwhelmed. The reality of the situation as a new server is that the management won\xe2\x80\x99t be giving you a 20+ table section. Realistically, it\xe2\x80\x99ll be 2-5. If you\xe2\x80\x99re feeling overwhelmed, stop at your server station collect yourself and always think 3 steps ahead... and breathe. All shifts come to an end, even if it feels like you\xe2\x80\x99re in a black hole.\n\n3. People get hired as servers for their personality. That will only get you so far, but it is also what you rely on. If you\xe2\x80\x99re the \xe2\x80\x9ccoolest\xe2\x80\x9d guy/girl you\xe2\x80\x99ll probably be making good money, but your work ethic, efficiency, and positive attitude is most likely what gives you the opportunity to pick up extra shifts and good parties etc... don\xe2\x80\x99t be a Chad.'
b"Particularly if you have a long walk from the kitchen to your section, make sure you check with ALL your tables that you think might need something, writing things down if you get a to-do list of more than a couple things, even without actual food orders. It's easy to want to go get something for a table right away, but it's easy to get stuck only helping 2-3 tables this way because they keep sending you back for more stuff, and neglecting the rest of your section. Check with all your tables, write down your list, and try to bring all those things (or as many as you can) with you on your next trip from the back. Better to have space your trips out every 7 minutes than every 3 minutes while neglecting half your section for 20."
b'Do some light yoga or good deep breathing with lower back stretches and leg stretches before your shifts - especially long shifts. I started doing this before every shift and it\xe2\x80\x99s *drastically* improved my stamina to work long hours. Even doing some stretches during my shift while it\xe2\x80\x99s slow helps keep me loose for the night. It seriously turned my nights from slow-killers to nights I can actually handle! Seriously, give it a shot!'
b"My restaurant's current server is down pretty frequently. Would it be cheaper to diagnose and fix the problem or just get a brand new one?"
b'So I can\xe2\x80\x99t stand when people talk with their mouths full. There really isn\xe2\x80\x99t much I can do about it when someone just blatantly ignores table manners, takes a huge bite of their burger, THEN asks for a refill with the burger still in their mouths. I nearly vomited once so I decided to put an end to it when I can help it. I usually work at low key places that aren\xe2\x80\x99t too fancy and I don\xe2\x80\x99t think you can do this at just any restaurant, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll go up to a table after the 2 min, 2 bite rule and say \xe2\x80\x9cAre you enjoying your meal?\xe2\x80\x9d And do a \xe2\x80\x9cSullivan nod\xe2\x80\x9d (nodding your head up and down while you ask the question) and also hold a thumbs up \xf0\x9f\x91\x8d\xf0\x9f\x8f\xbc Guests are usually very appreciative that they are able to respond to me with a thumbs up back \xf0\x9f\x91\x8d\xf0\x9f\x8f\xbc so they can continue eating without feeling the anxiety of having to swallow whatever is in their mouths real fast in order to respond. And I don\xe2\x80\x99t have to see any of their chewed up food. Win-win.'
b"what is excellent, 20%+ worthy service? I greet my tables promptly, ask them if they've been with us before, am quick with getting drink orders out, check up on my tables within 2 minutes of each step of food (apps, entrees), prebus, and get checks out before they ask and I'm also on top of drink refills yet I don't seem to get higher than 15% tip at most? Am I doing something wrong, is there anything more I can do? I also thank them for coming when presenting the check, too. "
b"How do you fight with leg pain/soreness? I started working as a server on weddings and I'm walking for basically 20 hours straight (in suit shoes for most of that time). The day after wedding my legs hurt like crazy and I can barelly walk at my home."
b"I've noticed that a lot of my friends/coworkers and myself have gone through this cycle when they start serving:\n\nYou are super excited to start serving and you get huge tips based on your enthusiasm.\n\nYou get used to it and trust yourself a little too much and stop getting so much. \n\nYou get tired of the job because you're making less and really start bleeding because your attitude.\n\nYou get happy or get a spark in your life and repeat the cycle. \n\n\n"
b"is it possible for a server who is vegetarian/vegan to succeed in a primarily meat/seafood-oriented establishment? I want to eventually move on to higher end restaurants, but a lot of higher end restaurants (such as those categorized with $$$$ on Yelp) are usually heavily meat/seafood-oriented and I feel like I'd be judged and questioned about why I'm working in such places if I can't even eat meat/seafood. "
b"Advice I give every first time you especially corporate places. Be you. Most guests don't want the same cookie cutter server, sprinkle some of your personality in there. "
b'I\'ve been at my job two months now and everything is going well. The way things are I have to wear a trainee shirt for the first three months. \n\nMy problem is with a coworker. He returned to work about three weeks ago and decided I\'m the one to take his control issues out on. We\'ll call him M. \n\nHe constantly tells me what to do in a rude manner, and undermines my ability to do what I\'m fully competent in. For example I\'ll be doing X routine task and he\'ll walk up and say "make sure you do it properly", or he\'ll be standing around chatting and say "run that food, clear table X, get the door" even when I\'m on my way to go do it. He\'ll constantly ask if I\'ve done X task when I know what needs to be done and when. I think he sees my trainee shirt and sees it as a power trip opportunity. \n\nLast night I was helping a customer and the phone rang. I heard M say to a coworker he\'s nice to "make [other guy he picks on] get the phone"\n\nI had my six week review with my manager at the end of a long shift dealing with this guy and was pretty stressed. When my manager asked if I had any concerns I cracked and vented and was told "oh he\'s actually really shy, my advice would be to chat to him more!" But that manager has now gone on sabbatical so I can\'t go back to her with the issue EDIT: I did try being chatty with him but it will go as far as "y\'alright?" "Yeah" and he walks off. I\'m not sure what I\'ve done but every interaction he\'s got this attitude with me. \n\nThe problem is I\'m really shy and non confrontational and I just go "okay" and do what he tells me while cursing him internally. He\'s also really well liked and respected by those that have been there longer than me and I\'d feel like a snitch telling anyone else. I\'ve vented to the other guy he tries to micromanage but his reaction is just "some people are just like that, I don\'t really care"\n\nWhat do I do?'
b'Is it okay if I comment for help? I\xe2\x80\x99m fairly new to serving and today I had two tables that took up all my time. Back to back they wanted my attention whether cause they need something or something was wrong. I had two tables to put food order in plus getting sat a 10 soon after and I saw them so I figured I put my food in and run the table drinks than go to there table... well they caught me when I was heading to the kitchen and kept saying we\xe2\x80\x99re ready to order when they were clearing not. \xf0\x9f\xa4\xa6\xf0\x9f\x8f\xbb\xe2\x80\x8d\xe2\x99\x80\xef\xb8\x8f what\xe2\x80\x99s the best way to deal with this or is there not and you just gotta hope for the best? '
b'Been working at my restaurant for about a year and a half and management is really cracking down on alcohol sales and the servers that sell the most alcohol get the better sections. I\xe2\x80\x99m kind of struggling to sell more alcoholic drinks....I always suggest some but people just want water. Any tips?'
b"I'll be starting training for a new serving job tonight, I'm 25 and it's my first serving job although I've been in customer service/food service since I was 15. I've worked at 5+ restaurants in the past, so I'm not *completely* clueless when it comes to food service. This current job at a local small sports bar/restaurant and I'm **TERRIFIED** to say the least. \n\nI am a very quick learner and have great problem solving/common sense skills, so interacting isn't a huge problem for me, but I tend to get lost in the details if there's a lot going on around me. What kind of things can I do/exhibit during training that will boost my manager's confidence in my skills? What kind of questions should I be asking her/the bartenders to best prepare myself asap with how they go about doing things?\n\nI'm also extremely, EXTREMELY nervous about carrying food. I'm a pretty small woman, and super nervous about dropping stuff. I have no idea what the typical protocol is for carrying food, it's probably my biggest worry about this job. \n\nAlso, what kind of things from my previous customer service/cook skills can I utilize to help transition into this serving position?"
b"Can we talk for a second? I've been a server for a really long time, but I can only carry three plates at once. My new restaurant accepts it but it's a HUGE place (it literally seats 400-500 guests. I've worked shifts were we had enough turnover that we had over 1200 guests). I've tried and tried to carry four plates and I just can't. What should I do?"
b'I\xe2\x80\x99ve been working as a server for a month, and have had two tables dine and dash on me. Any advice on how to stop this or spot potential tables that will do this? I feel like an idiot, and think it partly may be because I can come across as naive. (Or actually probably I am naive??) Both times were when it was super busy, as well my restaurant is often understaffed. '
b"So I've been serving for about 2 years now, but I just started serving at a place that uses Ziosks and I have no idea how to really deal with them. Some guests already know how to use them, and I don't always get the chance to offer dessert like I should or generally wish them a good day before they're already leaving. Other guests don't want to touch the Ziosks and will have me do everything using the POS, which I'm fine with. I'm just so awkward with how to approach each table about payment, since I'm never sure if they even want to use the Ziosks or want me to teach them how to use them. And then there's the matter of guests who know how to use them, but then the Ziosk decides to malfunction and I'm blissfully unaware because I've assumed that they don't need any help. Suggestions would be wonderful! "
b'So I\xe2\x80\x99ve been a hostess and started training as a waitress a few years ago but I moved before I got any good at it. I have a couple questions, first, how do you get a thick skin? Someone looks at my the wrong way at my current work and I panic, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure how to get over this. Also, I don\xe2\x80\x99t drink alcohol and I remember people asking me a lot about the taste of certain drinks and I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t answer. How do I get past that to be better at serving? Thank you!!'
b'Just started serving and I love it but I\xe2\x80\x99m 19 (in my state that means I can do everything except pour or open liquor) and I\xe2\x80\x99m really really struggling with all things having to do with alcoholic drinks. I\xe2\x80\x99ve never drunk a day in my life and inquiries by the guests about a certain alcoholic drink sends me running back to the bar to get a summary of it. This slows me down significantly, inconveniences the bar, and affects my professionalism so I was wondering if anyone had any suggestions for learning alcoholic drinks better without drinking.. \n\nAlso on a related topic.... How do I avoid awkward interactions when asking for IDs? Our store has a policy that we\xe2\x80\x99re supposed to card anyone who looks under 40 and today I asked a 35-year old woman for ID out of policy only to be told that she didn\xe2\x80\x99t have it on her (carpooled with someone else). It was super awkward cause she was CLEARLY over 21 but not obviously over 40 so now I\xe2\x80\x99m in the position of not being able to serve her because if I ask for ID and she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have it, it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t look very good on my if I just wave it off... \n\nWould really appreciate any help or thoughts here!'
b"I had posted a question on here about getting an interview late last week asking how to prepare for the interview this week. I had my interview on Tuesday and I had thought the interview had gone really well...actually, I had two interviews at the same place that day. Well I got a call this morning from the general manager of the place telling me I was hired to work as a waitress. I am so estatic I got the job. I am supposed to come in Monday for filling out paperwork and to get my shirts, aprons and have orientation. I officially start working on Thursday morning in which I'll be shadowing another girl and learning the ropes. So I am now wondering...\n\nNow that I have the job, what will I need for my first day?\n\nWhat are some good shoes I can get for waitressing that won't leave my feet so sore by the end of my shift?\n\nWhat can I do to prepare now for my first shift Thursday morning?\n\nI have a copy of the menu from the resturant. Is there any tips for memorizing the menu quickly?\n\nWhat are some general tips you can give for starting out?\n\nThanks so much again guys! I still can't believe I got the job! :D"
b"I just got a new job as a Server Assistant at a fine dining steakhouse. Any advice on carrying and balancing large oval trays? I'm super nervous about it because I literally feel like I'm going to drop it every time I carry it. I spilled water everywhere off the tray last night during my first day at work. "
b"are there any other servers with small hands and tiny wrists? I need advice on how I can carry three plates on one hand. Luckily my current job has us use trays but if I want to move on to other restaurants, I'll have to learn how to balance multiple plates on one hand, but my wrists are rather small and are poor at balancing things on it. "
b'I\'ll share some of the things that I\'ve picked up on over the past few years serving. I\'m not sure if they\'ve already been said, but I\'ll throw them in anyway. \n\nTreat the other staff very well. As long as it won\'t throw you behind, *always* be willing to help a coworker, be friendly with them, tip well when you come in to eat, etc, because more often than not, they\'ll remember your good deed and help you in a critical moment.\n\nSomething *big* that a lot of new servers seem to miss is to maintain a cordial attitude even if the customer is being a shitwad. Thick skin pays well. I\'ve paid several months rent by salvaging rude tables with a "grin and bear it" attitude. No matter how rude the customer is, only go off on them if they\'re threatening you, yelling/swearing, or sexually harassing you. I can\'t tell you how many times I\'ve had a guest that made me think "there\'s no way these fucking jackasses are gonna tip me" only for them to leave a great tip.\n\nWork on confidence and a strong, energetic appearance in any way that works for you. On a morning after a sleepless night, chugging coffee transforms me from a groggy, unenthusiastic sap to a charismatic salesman. Another time, after coming to work after having to bury my dog, my spirits were broken and it was showing in my tips. A coworker shared a swig of whiskey with me, not even enough for a miniscule buzz, and I went from making ~5 percent per table to 25 percent almost immediately. (Don\'t get drunk on the job btw, any more than a small amount is unacceptable, and even then only if you have a good tolerance). One other really weird technique is on the way to work, play a loud, high intensity song and sing it at the top of your lungs. Just don\'t shred your vocal cords in the process. \n\nManipulating guest perception by prioritizing shorter tasks (to a reasonable amount) seems to do me well. For example, I take a huge party\'s order. On the way back, someone asks for extra napkins. The napkins will take about 5 seconds, punching the order in will take about 2 minutes. The order will take 15 or 20 minutes to make anyway, so 5 seconds is nothing, compared to 2 minutes for a table that might only be there for 5 more minutes in total. Obviously not an absolute though, don\'t spend all your time neglecting to put an order in while you grab condiments and refills, obviously.\n\n'
b"I'm starting as a busboy this summer and would love some shoe recommendations. It's at a restaurant in a borderline five star hotel, so I would love something that looks like a traditional black dress shoe but with lots of cushioning. Looked at Shoes For Crews but most are ugly as sin, with the exception of some of the brand collabs. Also looking Rockports or Clarks. Any suggestions? Don't mind spending a bit of cash to look decent and save my feet this summer, looking at 50+ hour weeks. Thank you!\n\nEdit: Am Male."
b'Hey I have a question for anyone out here!? Have any of you worked for red lobster? I\xe2\x80\x99m looking at leaving a serving job of ten years for somewhere else... I have an interview at red lobster and am just wondering about things such a section sizes and what kind of tips people have made here or any other info you might have!\n\nI am leaving a place where at one point I was making $800 a week cash and the place is dying management and everyone knows it. Regardless little scary leaving after a decade l!'
b'Tip pool. \n\nYes, the cash gets distributed but I have been so afraid to ask because i feel that if I seem too worried about tips they will find more reasons to yell at me. I\xe2\x80\x99ve asked before and they have a very bothered facial expression and I think someone mentioned it before to the owner because she once told me \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s not about the tips you make, it\xe2\x80\x99s about the service.\xe2\x80\x9d  I have worked before in other jobs and I know what it\xe2\x80\x99s like to have a job, work hard, etc. \n\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t like that they don\xe2\x80\x99t let me sign off when I receive my tips. They scribble a non legible chicken scratch which confirms they have given me my tips but they also don\xe2\x80\x99t tell me what days it\xe2\x80\x99s for and the amount. They like to shove the tips out as if it\xe2\x80\x99s a secret when it shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t because we should get the tips split evenly. I\xe2\x80\x99ve never had a job like this and I have heard of sketchy things going on with tips not being distributed correctly. From what I\xe2\x80\x99ve noticed so far I have been getting a nice amount of tips and I find it odd that some days I\xe2\x80\x99m not given tips and others I do but when I ask for the date it\xe2\x80\x99s for they give me a stink face. \n\n'
b'Any tips for blisters on the bottom of your feet? I\xe2\x80\x99ve worked 27 of the last 48 hours. . . And I have Sunday brunch tomorrow. Please help!\n\nEdit: never mind I just showed up at work and they closed us . . . So I\xe2\x80\x99m officially drunk for the day. What the fuck. '
b"I'm a server with 8+ years experience. I've been based in Las Vegas the last 2 years and have just got my fine dining job. Feel free to ask me any questions about serving, restaurant work, Vegas, dealing with people. I've trained servers before as well."
b"Any tips for a server with really tiny hands on how to carry two cups in one hand? Every time I try to practice doing something like [this](http://www.tipssquared.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/011.jpg) one of the cups falls out of balance because my hands aren't big enough to hold both. It doesn't help that I don't have strong finger dexterity either. "
b"I recently started working for a restaurant that is super laid back. No rolling silverware, small side work, very little responsibility to clean your section. I really enjoy it so far. They charge the servers for all comped meals though. It so far hasn't been an issue but I'm not sure is that okay or legal? They also have a vegetarian section that includes several items cooked with meat in them and told me not to tell guests unless asked. Lastly, and this isn't the end of the world but they do a % tip out between the bartender and the bus boy. While the busboy earned during the day there is no bartender and the Manager just makes drinks but you have to find him and wait for him to come do it. That is very different then any other place I have worked. Do you guys think it's worth staying or should I look for a new place?"
b'I\'m working in a local Asian restaurant in a college town over the summer. I worked there last summer as a host, but this year when I couldn\'t find a job elsewhere, I came back to be a server even though I kind of hated it. The restaurant in question has terrible turnover with employees, and the mercurial temperament of the owners (one of whom I helped apply for citizenship last year) has led to all but one employee from last year being gone - the owners even lost the family members who used to work there, as they packed up and moved across the country overnight last November. I\'ve recently come to realize that they may be involved in unethical and perhaps illegal practices, and I\'m not sure what to do about it. It\'s late enough in the summer that I\'m unlikely to find a new job, and I really need the money to pay off medical bills and stuff. Anyway, the list of grievances is as follows:\n\n  \n\\* They take a 10&#37; cut of all servers\' tips at the end of the night, which I don\'t believe is standard practice for most restaurants. I was given a mostly unintelligible explanation (there\'s a significant language barrier) regarding "less taxes" (for us? for them? who can say?). We are also required to put a dollar in a jar from our tips every night "for the kitchen" (again, no clue what that means).\n\n\\* On my third day working as a server, I made a small mistake with the POS system, and an order was made larger than the customer wanted it. I caught my error as it was being cooked, and the little bit of extra veggies was used shortly thereafter because it\'s part of most meals that are ordered there, so no food was wasted. The owner still tried to charge me for the full meal at the end of the night anyway, even though the restaurant was still able to use and sell the vegetables with no interruption in productivity and I was a brand-new server who made a mistake due to the numerous problems with the POS system.\n\n\\* The owners (a married couple) periodically have loud arguments with each other and then spend the rest of the day trying to find reasons to pick at employees, making an already-stressful environment even more so.\n\n\\* They require us to come to work fifteen minutes before each shift officially "starts" and begin working, but we are only paid for the hours on the calendar schedule. In addition, if we have to stay past our scheduled time, we are not compensated for that, so when asshole customers decide to stay 20 minutes past closing chatting well after finishing their food, and we aren\'t allowed to start vacuuming or doing other closing tasks until they leave, we don\'t get compensated for that time. I worked over an hour uncompensated in this manner one day last week.\n\n\\* There is no effort made to ensure that servers even out to making regular minimum wage ($7.25) over the course of hours worked per month as a sum of tips and server wage ($2.13), so we just get to deal with whatever we make in tips.\n\n\\*Hand washing is not enforced, and given the owners\' insistence on efficiency, it is discouraged to slow down and wash hands between bussing tables and serving food (I do it and get bitched at anyway, because I refuse to be the reason someone gets sick).\n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated. I feel really stuck right now, and I don\'t want to screw over the owners because sometimes they\'re really nice and generous people and I really don\'t want my coworkers to get screwed further, but it\'s a pretty shitty situation and I feel like they\'re making extra money off the backs of their employees.'
b'Just got hired for my first server job in like 18 years. Can you guys help me figure out one thing that the manager mentioned? He said there would be handwritten tickets and he would tip me out at the end of the day. He was explaining something about credit card tips and if I would owe him or if he would owe me depending on how the credit card tips vs cash tips  worked out. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t follow, how would I owe him? I\xe2\x80\x99m sure it will be covered in my training I just was wondering because it stuck out to me. \n\nEditing to add a follow up question. I would love any tips on maximizing tips for a lunch shift at a small caf\xc3\xa9 in a small tourist town that also has a local community. Thanks!'
b'So I have been a host for nearly a year now. Tbh Ive prob been one of the better ones they had. Pretty much the job was answer phones, take, put, in and distribute to go orders, open doors, and since we are a very personal place, converse often with customers. I am hella comfortable around people and all that but they got me moving to the wait staff soon. I have been trained a bit as they needed me one day so I got carry like 3 plates and multiple drinks and all that. Anything else I need to know that may help with the transition? I got '

b"Hi everyone! I've been working as a server at a small hometown restaurant for a little bit, working sometimes 1 five hour shift a week to four all-day shifts in a week (It depends). My job involves a lot: taking orders, serving food, making drinks and desserts, cleaning tables, prepping and wrapping to-go orders, and general jobs like that. (Again we're a small restaurant so we work as a team.) However, my manager just talked to me a few days ago and basically told me that even though I work really hard, that I'm messing up little details too much. This is my first job, so that's one reason why I really don't want to mess this up. Here's what I need to work on:\n\n1.\tPricing: when a customer asks to add or put more of an ingredient in a dish (which is fairly often) some ingredients have a different price depending on what it is (the computer does not automatically do this). There are some we don't add as often that I'm not sure about pricing-wise, so I'm going to make flash cards to memorize them, even the ones I'm 99% sure I know. Have any of you worked around this sort of problem in a different way?\n2.\tCommunication: If a customer asks for something we don't have, or maybe is requesting something we normally don't do for a dish, what is a good way to gently lead them in a different direction or tell them we can't do [fill-in-the-blank]. My manager says I was being a little too blunt, and to explain things in a more roundabout way - any tips on how to do this or change how I word things like that?\n3.\tPrioritizing/Confidence: When I first started I was anxious to do well at this place (I still am), mainly because this is my very first job. Although I've definitely gotten better at becoming confident about what I'm doing, I still sometimes get a little anxious in my head and not prioritize a customer. Or, when I'm focusing on that too much, I'll ask a easily answerable question to one of the senior servers that I could've figured out just fine if I'd thought it through completely. What are some ways you guys have worked around this obstacle?\n\nI really love working at this place, and I want to make sure I do my part in helping out. Even though most everyone there speaks a different language than me 90% of the time, they are truly the nicest people on the planet, so I really want to do my best! Any tips on how to improve would be great. Thank you!\n\nAlso: sorry if formatting is a little off I'm typing this on mobile"
b"Hi! I'm not sure if this is being posted as a comment to the sticky noted thread or if it's being posted as a post, but what should I wear when going into bars and restaurants to hand inmy application and resume? I read that 2-4 is a good time to go in, when I go into a bar on a busy nightlife street, do those same hours still apply? Do I tell the hostess im there to hand in my application to a manager?\n\nThanks!"
b'I\xe2\x80\x99m not super new, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been serving for a year, but what\xe2\x80\x99s the best way to cut down on straw use?'
b"I am a 15 year old girl and I have never applied for a waitressing job...or really any job before outside of doing some housesitting for neighbors, walking dogs for neighbors or babysitting kids. So, I was out with friends and they suggested I apply to be a waitress even though I've never waited tables in my life and I've only ever done sports before. Some of my friends that work as waitresses are athletes as well. \n\nI filled out the applications for some places around town and I got called back for interviews this week. I've never interviewed for a job before and have now idea on how to prepare for it.\n\nWhat can I do now to prepare for my interview?\n\nWhat kinds of questions will they ask me?\n\nWhat are some things my interviewer will be looking for?\n\nHow can I ace my interview?\n\nWhat tips can you give me for my interview?\n\nThanks!"
b'I have worked in restaurants twice , one was like a diner and the other a more formal 2 floor venue. For the diner, i got paid an hourly rate, tips were not given by customers. The other restaurants, got paid an hourly rate and everybody on the floor pooled the tips and were shared out by floor staff only.\n\nThis is not America. I cant get my head around all waiting staff  not getting paid a decent hourly rate, i have seen threads here where employers pay $2 an hour, they customers then basically pay the staff bill. \n\nFor 10 hours a boss pays $ 20 for a staff member? \n1. What do you do if you just get mean tight arses who dont tip or just tip small amounts? \n2. Would a fixed amount of service charge be better to ensure you get paid a decent hourly wage? \n3. When you go to get finance, are tips included as revenue? \n4. I read somewhere that someone mentioned paying tax on tips? If that true\n\nI come from a cultural of not tipping but legal fixed hourly rates, and if you earnings are not enough you are entitled to an additional payment by the government.\n\n In service industries you would leave a tip for staff and general only see complusory service charges for large groups. Many places did try bring it in but it was not successful and wages are seen to be the employers responsibility.\n\nIt must keep overheads down if waiting staff are paid low wages. I just think you work hard, long hours, put up with crap and deserve a decent wage regardless of how many customers arrive or what they decide to tip.\n\nSorry for all the questions.'
b"I don't know how I can add something more to these incredible advices. But one that immediately came to mind from my beginner experience is: don't be afraid to tell the kitchen to do something different. I noticed that many patrons thought the soup (a restaurant favourite) that day was too thick. I hesitated for most of the day until I told the kitchen, who simply raised a friendly thumbs up in response. I should have acted from the beginning.\nLike they say here: don't be afraid to talk and ask for something from your fellow colleagues! It is a team effort. "
b"Looking for sneaker brand recommendations that don't kill my legs on 6+ hour shifts of standing! I've been trying to find a balance of cute (+black), affordable, and comfortable, but that sounds like I'm asking for too much!"
b'Yo so my manager has really been looking to faze me early recently, like these are some p loose accusations here b/c some days im really into it since I am a graduating college senior with a lot of other things I need to be doing, but I am afraid this will become a habit. Afraid cuz tbh shes an awesome server on top of being a floor manager and she can fairly certainly handle most of the restaurant by herself, and she really really likes doing it cuz she makes $$$ those nights. Rn Im really not sweating cuz I do have other things to be doing but coming into the Summer I wonder... Other than being a little firmer with her or going over her head or something dumb - do yall have any advice?'
b'Is it bad to ask how much tip we made at the end of the day? '
b"I am starting as a busboy this weekend, and plan to move into serving. What's the best way to study the menu?\n\nFlash cards? Quizlet? Writing it all down over and over? Etc.?"
b"The best thing I can say to that is she is already a horrible person so she is obviously not happy. You on the other hand have a future and seem like a great person. Life will do well for you, there are dark moments but that's when you learn how to rock out the best moments. "
b"\nThere are some truly horrible people in the world who will do anything for a free meal even run their waitress's reputation. I've had similar situations happen myself, but nothing on your level! It sucks that management didn't side with you. The 'customer is always right' motto is absolute crap. Hopefully you are treated better at this new job."
b"I'm sorry that this happened to you. I used to serve, but now I manage. Find yourself a place where your managers stick up for you.\n\n It sounds like you kept your manager updated on the whole situation and offered to do everything you could for what was already a difficult table. If the manager that was on that night is willing to let the GM punish you for something you didn't do instead of saying they were aware of the situation and you did all you could then that's not who you want to work with anyway.\n\nI'm guessing they'd rather let you take the heat than argue about something with an irrational gm, but that lack of trust is toxic in the restaurant industry when you can expect that there will be people who are just out for a free meal. Best of luck to you in the future."
b'It absolutely disgusts me that one customer/situation can absolutely screw over someone. Oh, 99% of the time you were amazing but this 1% time it lined up for you to get an insanely crazy person? \n\nLol nope, let\'s kill a employee\'s motivation to teach them a lesson, ignoring the fact that they\'ve been good up till this point.\n\nI worked at Wal-Mart once and was fired due to "no call no show". Problem was, I checked my schedule and didn\'t work the day I "skipped". So either I looked at my schedule wrong or my schedule was changed on me (which has happened to some employees before). Instead of going by my good track record; direct supervisor and long term employees liked me, showed up on time, was always doing what I could.\n\n They fired me, and another supervisor that I didn\'t work with much was in on the firing meeting. She told me I just wanted to skip even when I told my side of the story. Still pisses me off to this day because my word didn\'t matter, all that mattered was "Karen" thought I just wanted a free day off.'
b">By this time I was crying, I hate to admit that but I had no defense. I had no proof none of this was true.\n\nI know you were in no emotional state to defend yourself, but this is not your fault. There are any number of clues that management had access to: ticket times, what was on the ticket, the tip (if it was on a credit card), possibly cameras, and the actual interactions you had with the manager as things were going down.\n\nManagement there has just as much, if not more, blame than that lady. Yeah, she lied, but they totally neglected any sense of duty they might have had by not verifying one single thing she said. Writing that out makes me wonder if they didn't just make that whole story up because of something else you might have done."
b"I guarantee she's going to die without a single soul next to her on her deathbed. I've seen it a hundred times. Toxic person can't hold down a relationship because they drive them off. Parents eventually pass away after years of avoiding their abusive and manipulative child. Children cut all contact as soon as possible and never speak to the parent again. Toxic person dies alone and nobody cares enough about them to know. Only reason people realize it happened is because the neighbors start to notice the smell after a week or two.\n\nMaybe when she's alone and miserable she'll realize what an insufferable person she is and repent or feel some remorse for it."
b'I had a similar incident. Someone left a review on TripAdvisor. While paying the customer decided to inform me that her entree was over cooked even though I meal checked and she ate the entire thing with no complaint at the time. And her and her husbands pizzas were \xe2\x80\x9cinedible, bland and under cooked\xe2\x80\x9d. They each ate half and wanted the rest to take home. Again no mention of this during the meal when I refilled drink and meal checked. I ended up taking 50% off the bill. \n\nTheir child has been acting up the entire night and the last straw was when the kid tried to take money from the tip jar. I politely told the child to put that money back and explained who it was for and why people put money in and not take it out.\n\nI thought nothing of it at the time. The child apologised and the bill was halved. Customers \xe2\x80\x9chappy\xe2\x80\x9d and I\xe2\x80\x99d done my job. \n\nNext day I get a review which said I was shouting and swearing at them. Calling them names. Shouting at their child. Laughing in their faces over their complaints and did nothing to remedy the situation. \n\nThe owner reads the email and pulls me aside for a disciplinary meeting. He shouts and swears at me. But doesn\xe2\x80\x99t let me get a word in. Tells me that his trust in me is ruined (I\xe2\x80\x99m the restaurant manager. I run his restaurant as he\xe2\x80\x99s never around). He threatens to replace me. At this point I\xe2\x80\x99m just staring at him getting ready to blow up in his face. \n\nI resist the urge to shout and scream. I looked him straight in the eye and said \xe2\x80\x9chow dare you listen to a review over me. I\xe2\x80\x99ve worked here for over 2 years without a single negative review. I\xe2\x80\x99m listed by name in most of our good reviews. I\xe2\x80\x99ve never shouted and especially never sworn at work let alone in a customers face. If he decides to believe one review over 2 years of watching me work and reading positive reviews then I don\xe2\x80\x99t care about his trust in me because I\xe2\x80\x99ll be looking for a new job\xe2\x80\x9d. \n\nWe have an amazing camera system at my work. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t record sound but the resolution is so high and there are so many cameras around that you can see details of facial expressions from the entire encounter. He sees that they enjoyed everything, nodded when I asked how everything was tasting wanted to take food home. He saw that I never laughed at them or showed any negative behaviours. He also saw the kid taking money for the tip jar. And saw exactly how I handled it. \n\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve never seen someone do a bigger u-turn in my life. I\xe2\x80\x99m thankful for the cameras as proof. But I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have to rely on them. My boss should be trusting of his staff and less trusting in negative reviews. \n\nI almost lost my job. '
b'When I served, when I would get customers that were unhappy with their lives, I would mention it right form the get go to the owner or the highest in charge and have them "shadow me" from a distance while I am going to the table. This way I have someone to back me up if the customer lies. Good luck. '
b"If your Gm listened to a customer bitch for an hour then fuck her for not putting things together.  I'll bend over backwards for our customers, but if you cant tell me your complaint in under 3 minutes, and I offer you my solution in under 1 minute, then the customer is clearly the problem.  \n\nKeep your head up and stay motivated!  Not all places operate like that "
b"You would think that this GM would have the sense to realize that the woman complaining was slightly off and not worth very much time. I mean, it was a hamburger, a meal at a restaurant, and the burgers in question were comped.   \n\nUsing the schedule as punishment is childish. Changing jobs may have been your best move, but that doesn't lessen the sting of authoritarian management.       \n\nSpring is near, restaurants will soon be staffing up, think about trying to move up. As far as references go, use the burger place, you hosted for two years. The only thing they can really confirm is your length of employment. "
b"Corporate managers are spineless fucks. They'd much rather throw their workers under a bus and take the customers side because they know corporate only cares about the bottom line and screw everything else. In their eyes, all workers are disposable. Highly recommend finding a mom and pop restaurant, but I have to admit, I'm saying this as one of the lucky ones. I worked in corporate for years, never rose above bartender. Now I'm at a mom and pop place where the owners treat me and everyone else great and care about their staff. I started 2.5 years ago as a server and now I'm the GM. I never wanted a career in this business until I found the right place. I've used all of my experience with shitty corporate managers and act the complete opposite and because of that I have a staff that WANTS to work for me and we're a big happy family that kicks ass every shift. I don't understand why these bad managers can't see you catch more flies with honey than vinegar, or that it is actually hurting business to bow down to every Karen who complains."
b'The managers couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have went into the system to confirm the lemonade wasn\xe2\x80\x99t on the bill? If she\xe2\x80\x99s willing to lie about one thing, that would go a long way to proving your innocence. Oh well.'
b"I hate that she got her way, your management did not have your back.  All that previous good service and they didn't trust you?  Hope you are doing better soon!"
b"I had a similar situation happen to me. I had a two top of two ladies  that complained to my manager that I was acting strange (even though we were all laughing and joking together) and that I never brought out refills for their beverages (even though they just gotten refills 2 minutes ago). I was in shock since they were so polite and engaging to me so I went over and immediately apologized. About an hour after they've left, the older woman called the store to let my manager know that the other lady (assuming her daughter) was blowing things out of proportion and was exaggerating about what happened and that I actually did not do anything wrong. If it wasn't for that lady calling the store, I might've been put in a 2 - table section or even fired. "
b'When you get a feeling like that from one of your tables tell the manager before you drop the check to keep an eye out. From your story it seems like they never interacted with this bitch.'
b'I hear horror stories about dickhead patrons from my sister all the time. She works at a place where less than high society like to go play pretend high society and the stories she tells me are infuriating. Snarky pricks, jealous wives, condescending douchebags. They all come out to this place. \n\n\n\nI go out for dinner most Friday evenings and I\xe2\x80\x99ve never understood this compulsion to make the staff feel like their beneath me. Unfortunately in the last few years I\xe2\x80\x99ve noticed my family can act this way when I go out with them for an occasion. Like even if there is a small mistake, you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to be a smarmy prick about it. If it\xe2\x80\x99s a mistake that takes very little to rectify, just deal with it. If I ask for no onions on a burger and there\xe2\x80\x99s onions, I scrape them off. If I ask for no mayonnaise and there\xe2\x80\x99s mayonnaise then I politely ask the waitress if she can sort it out and she\xe2\x80\x99s more than happy to. The thing a lot of people forget is it\xe2\x80\x99s usually not even the waitresses fault, the kitchen staff make mistakes too. \n\n\n\nThe worst is cheap owners who are always cutting corners which lead to mistakes and it\xe2\x80\x99s the wait staff who end up catching the heat for it. \n\n\n\nI\xe2\x80\x99m rambling at this point but I really hate the \xe2\x80\x9cholier than thou\xe2\x80\x9d attitude a lot of patrons seem to have when they go to a restaurant.'
b'This is entirely your managers fault. Exactly this reason is why managers should always touch the table if they\xe2\x80\x99re is a complaint.   You did absolutely nothing wrong.  I\xe2\x80\x99m so sorry this happened to you.  Your GM was a bitch too. '
b'A Good Manager would of watched the cameras and seen it didn\xe2\x80\x99t take 30 minutes to giver them check. A Good Manager would of pulled their bill up and seen they where not charged for a lemonade. That GM will probably fail too. You will find your place! '
b"I'm so very sorry this happened to you and cost you a job you loved.  I've worked for chain places with crap management before and learned pretty fast just how quickly management would throw you under the bus to cover their own butts.  It sucks.  I'm glad you're on to better things now.\n\nI don't understand people that pitch a fit over things like this person's overcooked burger, especially having already been comped and hernot being the customer who paid!! \n\n I listened to kids I went to hs with brag about what they did to anyone's food if they complained or sent it back and it scarred me for life, lol.  I have eaten raw steak and choked down very well done filet minons at restaurants.  I've eaten food that literally made me sick in the restroom before we even left the restaurant. I've brought home food I couldn't eat and thrown it out once home.   My family and I have  had absymal service a few times too, but we just got through it or paid and left asap.  I never have complained to anyone other than very quietly to my husband and kids if asked, except one time when a server noticed I was struggling to force myself to choke down my food and she kinda forced it out of me that it wasn't properly cooked.  She said when she returned that she, personally, took it back and watched them recook it because she could tell how nervous I was sending it back.  Turned out fine.  I ate it happily and we tipped her extra for going above and beyond for me. \n\n We tend to be semi-regulars at our favorite places and have a few servers that we've developed a fun rapport with.  I've, thankfully, never seen a complete wacko customer at any of our usual spots.  I don't think I could witness something like that and say nothing.  I know we've had far more excellent server experiences than the few bad ones.  We do try to remember everyone has rough days and we alter our expectations when a place is slammed and/or obviously short-staffed.  Servers can't help those things and servers are not the cooks, so food issues of that nature are also not the server's fault.  Mad props to cooks too for not having more mistakes than they do.  They can have it really rough too.  I just don't understand what's so hard about remembering these things and being kind to those serving you.  Some people just suck:(.\n\nThere is a fast food plus eat-in buffet place we go to now and then that seems to catch hell no matter what they do for people.  I always try to help them out a bit by cleaning up the drink machine area and little things like that and go out of my way to compliment every employee I can when we eat there. People can get batshit crazy for absolutely no reason at all!!  Customers there have just torn workers apart over nothing!!  I try to be within their earshot and talk to my kids about leaving the world better than we found it, hoping some of it sinks in to the person I'm really trying to reach.  I doubt it helps, but I do it calmly and look at my children when speaking so it appears to be a parenting move."
b'Jesus. This woman sounds like a nightmare. Who talks on the phone for an hour over a burger. It sounds like the mother was embarrassed of her daughter. People are so quick to turn the situation \n\nI once had a table write a complaint about my manager saying that she overheard her talking to a table and refusing to give them a free meal. She also said her food was over cooked and I refused to get them new food and I took forever to serve them. Literally none of that was true. The table she over heard found a piece of bone in their food so the manager comped the entire tables food plus gave them desserts to go. My manager was so apologetic and I know this because I was at the table while they were talking. This lady never mentioned her food being over cooked and if it was I would have had it remade, it happens a lot (burger joint) so I\xe2\x80\x99m no stranger to over or under cooked meat. And my manager pulled up the entire check time, and it was well within reason of a reasonable check time. This lady lied through her teeth and sent the email to our corporate manager prompting a phone meeting due to a manager getting a complaint like that. The entire time, the lady was a bitch but never once said anything was wrong. People can fucking suck. '
b'"Fake outrage for free food can have consequences for your servers."\n\nYeeeeaaa... I guarantee you the people who fake outrage for free food don\'t give a fuck.'
b'Good mangers check the situation and don\xe2\x80\x99t trust what the guest says as 100% true. '
b'So sorry to hear. Have been serving for 8 years and have definitely been in situations like the one you mentioned. Glad you kept your head up and continued to wait tables. I actually find it more rewarding than not. These are the actual stories that should be on this sub. I swear so many times people on here are all \xe2\x80\x9cwoe is me\xe2\x80\x9d , are more rude (given their position) than they think, or are just actually bad at the job. Thanks again for posting a real one and best of luck.'
b"It sucks you can't give out names, I'd make sure to never patronize if that's how they treat workers."
b'If the manager was comping the bill they should have gone to the table to check that everything was alright. And if someone finishes their meal they shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be comped for it! (On the grounds that \xe2\x80\x9cit tasted bad\xe2\x80\x9d or wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the way they wanted it.)'
b"It was wrong for the GM to side with the customer without a thought to your good reputation. I'm sorry you had to go through that. If I had been you, I would have quit as soon as I realized the GM was siding with the customer. The GM can choke on a bag of dicks along with that horrible excuse for a human being."
b'Of course you had proof, for one the bill would have showed there was no lemonade charged. You also could have checked the times on the ticket to see if the "30 minutes to bring a check" seemed likely. '
b'So if one just becomes a total frigging asshole they can eat free 7 days a week as long as they go to corporate places?  You guys may need to stop posting this info lest it get out to the wrong people.   Since I\'ve been reading this sub, i\'ve been like " are they really people like this??"  Never seen em,  never been with em and hopefully never will.'
b'My mouth freaking fell open! I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe they actually demoted you, basically!!! I am so sorry and that lady should rot in hell! I am so sorry!!! Oh my gosh. This is the craziest story. Goes to show corporate places are ASS'
b'Ugh. People suck ass sometimes. When I was about 16, I got fired from my job because a fat "Karen" demanded a manager because she said I put the salad on her table down too hard. It was in a ceramic bowl and it made a noise when I placed it on the table. She just wanted a comped meal. I had to go back to her table, in tears at this point, and apologize. Then I was fired.'
b'Your GM was a fucking idiot to not realise the signs of crazy from this lady and to treat you like that. It wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been that hard for them to realise it was lies even without cctv footage. \n\n\nComplained they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t eat the burgers? Check with the bussers and dishies to see how clean the burger plates were that night. There was a lemonade on their bill? Literally just check the POS and receipt history, dockets are kept for a long ass time for accounting purposes. Said there was a long wait time for the bill? Again, just check the POS. It will have a backlog somewhere that the management could have checked to see at what times you accessed that table and when their bill was both printed and paid. \n\n\nYou did nothing wrong. You got screwed over by a manager with no integrity and no respect for their employees. I know you got good money there, but it would have been a detriment to you in the long run. Be thankful you got out, even though it\xe2\x80\x99s tough right now. Good servers always find their feet in the industry. '
b'The thing that sticks out to me more then anything else is management being so ready to believe her and not you.  I have served that same woman a hundred times and if any issues ever go to management obviously they do the apology dance and comp as necessary, but never once have they sided with the guest without a valid reason.  How new to the industry are they to not get that they were just dealing with " one of those"?'
b'>Apparently my GM had called her the next morning and they were on the phone for an hour.\n\nWho has a full hour to complain about a dining experience?  Doubly so for someone who has kids.  Lady sounds like a nutjob.'
b"Hey pardon my French but fuck those managers. People can be great and people can be nuts, if you're a good manager you know how your servers are and how people can be. Not only that if there was a problem with the food the manager should automatically talk to the table as well. Just comping things to brush it under the rug speaks volumes. To choose one random customer's word over many others and over how they know you work and to treat you like that is disgusting. Sorry you had to go through that. "
b"The fact that your GM doesn't have your back is bonkers to me.  I feel in their position that your reputation should carry you over these speed bumps of terrible customers.  The fact is like some of the other comments here, the lady is miserable.   By her calling the manager and and writing a letter has something to say about that person's character.   People like that I wish could be put into a 3rd world country and expected to survive for a month.  So that when they do come out of a situation like that, they can appreciate the small things in their life and not become a terrible person. "
b"Corporate is the worst! Fuck the customer! Us servers work for the customers! if we were shit we would make shit! When everyone is against you, you're destined to fail! tl:dr worked as a server 12 yrs, corporate sucks! "
b"Fuck that bitch. no wait, that's what you should have said to your GM. Character assassination is an accurate way to put that situation and next time it happens (it will if you stay in this industry) stand up for yourself, call that lying piece of shit what they are and make sure your management understands what happened. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nA good way to set yourself up to dodge this stuff is to tell your manager about these shitty tables throughout the night. Every sullen silence, dismissal of something that would actually make their lives better. everything. Then when that phone call comes or they leave a shitty online review full of bullshit, your MOD will look at it, dismiss it with a shake of their head, and you all move on to the next one. "
b'Fuck that bitch. And I absolutely hate managers that take the word of a customer over a tried and true employee.\n\nI hope you find/found another place.\n\nBut yeah, fuck that bitch sideways with a 10 by 4'
b"Something similar happened to me while I was working at a family restaurant on mother's day.\n\nOne of the family's kids lied saying I'd drooled on their son's food, and filed a scathing complaint online, which was printed out and posted in my work area.\n\nThankfully that location recently closed down."
b'She\xe2\x80\x99s a wanker. I\xe2\x80\x99m so sorry you had to deal with her. Wish I could give ya a hug. '
b"I'm so sorry that happened to you. That one woman's crazy rants could have such a significant impact on you as a server and your future earnings.\n\nI agree with the other posters who say that she's a miserable woman, I'd imagine most people enjoy going out to dinner with three generations! But instead, she decided to ruin everything. I'll bet her parents are ashamed of her."
b"So freaking annoying how selfish, inconsiderate, and entitled some people can be. They think it's just a free meal for them, but don't think about the consequences we have to face. I'm sorry this affected you so negatively in the long run. People shouldn't eat out if they don't have the common decency to treat service workers with respect."
b'Im so sorry you had to go through with that, your manager and boss were complete assholes.'
b'You dodged a bullet in regards to the workplace. The place sounds like a bad SO. That behavior would have just manifested itself later. It\xe2\x80\x99s probably better that it happened earlier in your time with them so you could get out and start over. '
b'Sadly that\xe2\x80\x99s pretty common and it is awful that your manager didn\xe2\x80\x99t side with you over ONE customer. One day we were slammed and they had under scheduled. I was the only one working the front and was still relatively new so the slow service and food that had cooled down I took responsibility for. The complete slander of my character by a customer was a total lie and all my coworkers backed me up. They said I was always sweet to customers and usually very friendly with everyone so there was no way I was screaming at coworkers or rolling my eyes at the customers...'
b'I\xe2\x80\x99m a restaurant GM, and the fact that yours didn\xe2\x80\x99t have your back in the situation speaks volumes about their management. It\xe2\x80\x99s one thing to consider a customer\xe2\x80\x99s side in a dispute, but it\xe2\x80\x99s another not to recognize the crazy in the customer and put that against the track record of a good employee. If this really went down like you said it did then that company does not have your best interest at heart and is a large red flag. '
b'There are and will always be assholes like this for as long as you work in the service industry. Unfortunately you weren\xe2\x80\x99t there for long enough to prove yourself (at least in your GM\xe2\x80\x99s eyes). The positive thing is that once your managers know your a great worker, in my experience, they will usually always have your back when a complaint from someone like this comes in. Keep it up, scope out some busier places using google if you can! And always go in face to face to smile and have a chat with the manager when you apply. \nI wish everyone knew how draining the industry is. Emotionally, physically, mentally... we as servers have to deal with a lot of shit. But it had turned me into such a strong person who knows how to deal with anyone. To think, I used to be incredibly shy up until I started working in customer service. It really helped me open up and understand myself, and all of the different types of people in this world. '
b"Here's the truth of the matter. I've been on both sides of that coin, and what it boils down to is your previous management has no idea how restaurants function. That shit happens all the time. You always side with good employees, or you lose them. Also, there will always be crazies like what you deal with. That's part of the game. Take care of your people ( meaning your employees) first, and let the silly shit slide. I would have never even brought this up with you, were I your manager"
b"These people crop up all the time. Less people do it to me because I'm a dude, though. When I served I always made good friends with my hosts and hostesses, and they started seating all the old folks and retired vets in my section since I'm a vet myself, not a lot of good money from old people tipping 1 or 2 dollars, but i got them in and out fast enough to make average money most nights and my regulars loved me.\n\nI switched to a different restaurant and started the same process, but instead of a more southern hospitality type of crowd, it was a largely jewish and more well off crowd (new place was a jewish deli chain in south florida in a more well off area of my city, old one was a country place that is all over the country). These people could be INCREDIBLY entitled and scammy. \n\nMy last day working as a server, i helped someone by running their food to a table. This table complains about their food being cold (it was steaming) and how it had been 20 minutes since they ordered (they ordered something that takes 15-20 minutes to make, during lunch rush). I pointed these things out to them and the probably mid-40s guy starts to get up out of his booth very aggressively, so I stand in the way of the booth and glare down at him, he asks me if i know who he is, like he is a politician or something. I say no, and I dont care, I'm an Army vet and that he couldn't matter less to me. He keeps trying to be tough so I just walk to the managers office, tell her I am quitting, tell her all the shortcuts and handouts her other servers are doing that are costing the company money, finish my sidework, and leave.\n\nRestaurant customers are literally the worst people. I didnt have the patience for it anymore, but keep your chin up, its damn good money if you can shrug it off."
b"I've said this before on this sub and will say it again now:  Be courteous, not nice.  \n\nThere are narcissists in this world who spend all of their time looking for 'nice' people - people who are open, trusting and willing to go the extra mile.  And these people are willing to go the extra mile to destroy all the nice people they can.\n\n I would bet good money that your manager and GM were afraid she would go after them. You met an evil asshole and now you know the signs, cover your ass well the next time you see those signs."
b'Ugh.ugh.ugh.  that bitch has cancer, ulcers, cirossis and other painful shit in her future.  (I know that lovely people get cancer as well, but someone that evil just is a festering tumor waiting to blossom.)\nYou did not deserve that! '
b'Fuck these wankers, you seem like a good person, no one should have to take this sort of bollocks and have to toady up scum like that. I hope you find a better job where you can be appreciated x '
b"I did a fake outrage? last night. The onion rings fell on the clean table.... Lols. The server knew I was kidding....we've been there quite a few times."
b"I literally moved cities to work at a seafood restaurant that my boyfriend at the time worked at. At first, I really liked it and I got along well with my co-workers. But starting out as a host, it was terrifying because it was a pretty fancy restaurant and the patrons we're constantly rude and critical of the hosts which is what I started out as. Typically, it would take three write-ups to result in a termination. One day, a very bitchy customer told my manager I rolled my eyes at her (I would never do that, I tried to uphold the company 'look' and be professional) and I also only had one write up (for not getting to the door in time to open it for someone) I was brought into the office, and told they were letting me go because I needed to learn how to be more professional. I couldn't even respond to them because if I had said anything I would have burst into tears. I was banking on that job to save up and move with my boyfriend. I was so upset and felt so betrayed and weird after they fired me and took the guests word over mine after I had put so much effort into that job and was constantly taking shifts and coming in for them. After that I really resolved to not put so much of myself into a business that I work at if I can tell the management doesn't care as much as I do. Their loss honestly, they got rid of an employee who really cared when many of the other host who were left didn't and called out a lot. I've never felt so anxious at a job as I did that one because there was so much you could get in trouble for as a host. I work at a new restaurant, it's definitely not perfect but my manager is super nice and we're all like a family and a team and help each other out. Look at the bright side, you don't want to work at a place where one mistake lead you to being ostracized and having your life and money messed with. It really shocks me that people in the general public are willing to literally ruin people's lives over some free food or a drink. "
b'I fully support an uprising. People are morons. It\'ll hurt, but I\'d like to see how corporate "the customer is always right" places survive when they have no workers willing to bend over backwards for $3.'
b'I had a cozen who was like that. He was on total disability so he never worked. He would go into a restaurant just looking for any excuse to start trouble with those who were working for a living. His reason for doing this was to see how much in free meals he could get. He would get the name of the server and call the district manager to complain. He was 5 years older than me and we grew up a few blocks from each other, so we had some shared history together. I tried to be a friend to him, but he really proved over time that he was a total jerk off to other people to the nth degree. He fucked over his parents as well and stole $40,000 cash from their home when they were both in the hospital. He also somehow convinced his father to divorce his mother after about 30 years of marriage. His own mother referred to him not by his name but by calling him the monster. Long before that he also tried to get a female cousin to have sex with her when she was 14 and he was about 23. I remember him telling me that he was planning to try to seduce her. He also told me that if the cousin turned him down he was going to try for her mom(his aunt)I was about 17 at the time and strongly advised him not to to that. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t realize at the time that he was serious, nor did I realize yet how profoundly fucked up he was as a human being. I kind of forgot about it until a few years later when my female cousin told me that he had attempted it unsuccessfully a while back. My first reaction was to say,  \xe2\x80\x9c So he actually went through with it\xe2\x80\x9d I was completely sure that he was guilty as charged because he told me ahead of time what his intentions were. I never found out if he hit on our aunt, or wether he had succeeded with her. She and my uncle split up a little while later. Don\xe2\x80\x99t know if this had anything to do with it. After the whole event had come out in the open, he vehemently denied everything and called our cousin a liar. He said that she made the whole thing up. I called him on the phone and told reminded him of our conversation about his plan with her. He told me that we never had that conversation and that I must have imagined it. And wanted to know why I would make something like that up. He was basically shunned from the family and died fairly young. Good bye, Monster. '
b'I believe karma to be a thing. I can tell you right now (and please take joy from this) that one day she will pull the same gag in another establishment and will literally be told to \xe2\x80\x9cfuck off\xe2\x80\x9d. \n\nEchoing what everyone else has said, you sound like someone who has their head on their shoulders and is very switched on. Believe in yourself and know that you\xe2\x80\x99ll go far with whatever you put your mind to. '
b'Fuck that stupid bitch. No good manager is going demote a worthy server over a Karen complain. Keep applying, no new restaurant is going to call your last joint. '
b'misery loves company. i remember when i first started working food service, my store was full of locals and my locals are very rude so needless to say i never started off with nice customers. i always felt that i was doing something wrong so i would try to be extra nice and even give out discounts but nope still got yelled at, given attitude and even complained about. 2 years later and i stopped giving a single fuck about my customers. no i\xe2\x80\x99m not rude but i\xe2\x80\x99m also not the happy go lucky girl i started off as. i don\xe2\x80\x99t make talk i just get their order, smile and ring them out while saying have a nice day. don\xe2\x80\x99t beat yourself up over a miserable lady '
b'I\xe2\x80\x99ve been a server for seven years and I\xe2\x80\x99ve had my share of complains and screw ups but I have never in my life had my hours cut or been put in a smaller section over one angry table. Whatever restaurant you worked in obviously had no respect for their servers. So many questions came into my mind when reading this. Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t the manager go to the table if you needed a comp? Why was the entire meal comped because the burgers were a little over done, should it not have just been the burgers? Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t your manager explain what happened to your GM? This situation was just handled terribly by management from the ground up. I truly hope that if you decide to serve again you find yourself at a restaurant that respects its employees and understands how to handle customer complaints accurately. Just for reference, I\xe2\x80\x99ll outline how this should have been handled. \n\nCustomer complains about food being overdone. You grab manager, explain what\xe2\x80\x99s going on, and the manager engages with the customer to right the issue. New food is made or the food not eaten is comped. Manager puts in for a dessert and you deliver it. Manager checks in again before customer leaves to ensure satisfaction. If a complaint comes in the next day it is handled between management with no server involved because manager was present for the duration of the transaction and knows the details. Nothing else comes of it. \n\nLazy managers can break a restaurant easier than anything else. I\xe2\x80\x99ve worked at places where I had to beg managers to come speak to tables. That is absolutely not how it should be. It\xe2\x80\x99s one of the first things I ask now when interviewing for new server positions - \xe2\x80\x9cHow does management here handle customer situations?\xe2\x80\x9d And \xe2\x80\x9cWhat area of the restaurant has the most management promotions?\xe2\x80\x9d I ask the second question because a restaurant full of managers promoted solely from BOH or FOH is in hot water. It takes managers from all restaurant positions to ensure problems are handled accurately. Sorry for the long comment, I just feel strongly about restaurant management lol. '
b'I had a very similar situation happen to me.  It was not made secret that the DM and owner were actually going to fire me over it,  All over $10 worth of free food and ice cream.   Then they treated me like crap, reduced my hours, had someone steal from my till on evening shifts but was salty when I quit with no notice leaving them hurting during busy season.  The saddest thing about my situation was I\xe2\x80\x99d known everyone there since I was a kid, and they knew me to know how bizarre and untrue the complaint was.  I was dealing with some medical issues too and always gave 110% despite feeling like trash.  It definitely is a big hit to the morale.  '
b'It sounds like this place is no good. I get that the \xe2\x80\x9ccustomer is always right\xe2\x80\x9d but that is usually applied when dealing with the customer, then you talk to the member of staff who served them privately to get the full picture. Your manager should have trusted you more, especially given that this was your first \xe2\x80\x9coffence\xe2\x80\x9d.   Once a drunk customer asked me to take a picture of her on her phone, which she dropped and broke when passing it to me, then told my manager I smashed up\nHer phone, my manager believed me. You are better off without them and being in an environment where you can flourish. Hospitality is sometimes one step forward, two steps back, but it\xe2\x80\x99s just as much finding the right place as it is being the right person'
b'If u give us the number we can call in a complaint for how they treated u'
b"I'm so happy to hear you just threw it away. That's absolutely bullshit that she just threw it down and walked away. If you just left it there, we assumed it was trash since you didn't tell us it was important. \xc2\xaf\\\\\\_(\xe3\x83\x84)_/\xc2\xaf"
b'Oh my god we must be on the same wavelength. I literally JUST got on break and was going to post because I had to serve some MLM Huns for a \xe2\x80\x9cbusiness conference\xe2\x80\x9d today \n'
b'We had a girl come in with one of these at the coffee shop I work at too! At first she told me she was opening a salon and wanted to get people in the door with the free facials or whatever. Didn\xe2\x80\x99t even cross my mind it would be Mary Kay until I read the papers attached. WTH??! New marketing ploy??'
b'Thats some next level stupid by the hun, holy crap'
b"That wouldn't fly in my establishment, either. I also hate it when flyers are left for other venues. Like, really?! Why, for two seconds, would we want to promote another venue? That would be like leaving coupons for Church's Chicken at KFC. "
b'Spell better'
b'There was one couple that tried a dine n dash at  place I worked at. They had a purse and left it on the seat and said they were just going out to smoke. 10 minutes later we realized they hadn\'t come back and were gone. We took the purse into the back and opened it up. Empty besides a womens wallet. Inside the wallet were just cardboard pieces where a "fuck you" was written on one of them. It was actually kinda genius. However, the table right next to where they were eating happen to know who they were. She gave us one of their names, and we looked on Facebook for them. Yup, there they were. We took a picture of the "fuck you" cardboard piece and attached it to a message telling them to come back and pay, or we will notify the police. They decided to tell us to fuck off so we notified the local PD. It took less than 2 hours for the police to arrest them since they kept taking pictures and posting them on the restuarant Facebook page with their location tag on, trying to mock us. It was maybe the funniest story I\'ve ever had working in the industry. '
b"At my last place, we had a lot of walkout scum. We kind of let it go because what are you gonna do, and our safety was worth more than a $20 meal. However, this one chick was NOT about to let it happen, when a young couple said their wallet was in the car (who even forgets it there) and she went all FUCK NO, one of you stays. She ran to get our gm who kept him waiting in the lobby, she's kinda scary.\n\nEventually, he made a run for it.. but gm just burst out laughing. She knew he'd eventually bolt, and had secretly called the cops over and they were waiting in the parking lot across the street. He kept on running, she he ended up having to pay the bill, plus some fine Florida has, PLUS a charge for fleeing. \n\nHis partner was still on the run, and last he'd come in, they got news she was hiding away in some attic. I only know this all, because I was there, and the cop really came back a few times throughout the day to update us. Best part, they BOTH had to seperately pay the cost, plus the fine. So a $20 meal ended up being over $500 combined."
b'The other day I had a party of 6 nearly walk out on their bill. The first guy comes up to pay his share and leaves, while the rest of them are still gathering their belongings at the table or whatever. So I am about to take payment from another table who are ready to pay when I notice the rest of this party just walking out the front door? Maybe they assumed that the first guy had paid the entire bill cause the last one to leave seemed quite surprised and disappointed when I informed him that there was still quite a lot left on their tab. '
b'There was a woman that tried to dine and dash at a restaurant I worked at once. All she ordered was a sandwich, ate half of it, and was caught by someone as she tried to climb out the bathroom window.\n\nWe asked her why she was doing it and she said she was hungry but had spent the last of her money on gas to keep her car running as she was living in it.\n\nWe told her to go finish her sandwich and while she was doing that I cooked her up a proper meal so that she could at least leave with a full belly.\n\nWe just marked the meal as wastage and moved on.'
b"I once chased after a dine and dash for a place I didn't even work at.\n\nWe were waiting for our take out when a group of teens all bolted for the door. The hostess tried stopping them but she slipped on the floor and they continued past her. I think it was seeing her take physical harm that made me just take off after them. \n\nI actually caught up and tackled one dude, but he managed to slip out of his coat and run into the mall across the street. It was only after the adrenaline wore off that I realized I could have gotten hurt myself.\n\nBest part was that one of the kids forgot his backpack in the booth, which had his phone in it. One of the waitresses called his mom, so dude had to pay and was in for a world of trouble at home to boot."
b'We had a table similar to this last week during a huge snowstorm. Their bill was about $85 and they only left a $5. Their server picked up the cash just as they were leaving the front door and chased them all the way to their car. They got in to drive away and their car was stuck in the snow that had accumulated while they were inside eating. Our manager comes out and threatens to call the police, they refuse to get out of the car. So the police come and they get arrested and my manager called to have their car towed. \xf0\x9f\xa4\xb7\xf0\x9f\x8f\xbc\xe2\x80\x8d\xe2\x99\x80\xef\xb8\x8f'
b'Couple of years ago our trivia team, 8 of us, was at our favorite joint enjoying the game and food & drink. Our favorite server was doing her usual excellent job. She came to our table mid-evening crying. Turns out a good-sized party had walked out without paying on a $300+ tab. The owner apparently required servers to cover such tabs. When we paid our tab, we chipped in and paid that one too, plus a tip on it. My SO saw the young lady, a single mom, in the grocery later that week and she cried all over again. [Please don\xe2\x80\x99t suggest she was scamming us, she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t]. I reported the owner to the appropriate authorities in that state, since requiring restaurant staff to cover dine-and-dash tabs was illegal. He changed his polcy. We remain friends with the server and her delightful little daughter. She found a nice guy and we went to their wedding.'
b"In the future, never chase a dine and dasher into the parking lot.  Servers have literally gotten killed doing this.  It's not your money getting lost, and if a restaurant is douchey enough to give you a write up for having a dine and dash you shouldn't be working there anyway."
b"I call it the Value Village Dine & Dash.  Spend $20 on a cheap coat and bag, go for dinner, sneak out for a smoke and don't return.\n\nBest story I heard was a guy leaving hi iPhone on the bar. When the bartender finally picked up the abandoned phone he realized it was a kids toy"
b">Our restaurant has two parts, the full restaurant, and the \xe2\x80\x9cwaiting bar\xe2\x80\x9d that\xe2\x80\x99s in a different room.  If you\xe2\x80\x99re bartending in the waiting room, you\xe2\x80\x99re your own busser/server/bartender. People can order a couple of apps and drinks while they wait for their buzzer to go off.\n\nJust as a sidenote, that's a great idea. "
b"Damn man. Same thing happened to one of my co-workers last night apparently. Couple came in after close with some elaborate story about how they'd been on the road all night and they really appreciated them staying open a little later. Yada yada. He even went as far as going over to the hotel we share a building with to get them $30 off the rate of a room. Then at one point the guy left, they thought he was checking into the room. Then the girl leaves. And they're gone gone. But there's a wallet on the table. Totally empty besides a Costco card (of the actual man who was in the restaurant) so these dummies walked out on a $100+ tab and left a photo ID to report them with."
b'WOOOOWWW\n\nSo I\xe2\x80\x99ve never dined and dashed, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t know anyone who\xe2\x80\x99s admitted to it either, but I guess I always assumed it was an \xe2\x80\x9cin the moment\xe2\x80\x9d situation when it did happen. Either the people doing it had a little too much to drink and got carried away, or they realized neither of them had enough money to cover the tab/it ended up being more than they wanted to spend, and they just sort of..... slip out. The fact that these people stood at home together and thought \xe2\x80\x9chow can we go to a restaurant and get a free meal?\xe2\x80\x9d And actually concocted a plan, where she [presumably] went through her belongings and found a purse she didn\xe2\x80\x99t care about, and they worked out how she\xe2\x80\x99d leave with her wallet and he\xe2\x80\x99d follow..... its, impressive in a way, but on a level of sleaze I never really thought about in these situations. How shitty do you have to be to go to all of that trouble? I understand that capitalism sucks, and poor people deserve nice things and a night out too- but when you dine and dash you aren\xe2\x80\x99t hurting a corporation, you\xe2\x80\x99re hurting a server who\xe2\x80\x99s making shit money too. \n\nSteal from fucking Walmart, don\xe2\x80\x99t walk out on your bill at a restaurant. \n\n*Am I being downvoted because I hinted that I don\xe2\x80\x99t think Walmart deserves to be treated fairly/cared about over poor people?* \xc2\xaf\\_(\xe3\x83\x84)_/\xc2\xaf '
b'\xe2\x80\x9cGo ahead and takeoff on your tab, it\xe2\x80\x99ll be worse when the cops show up to your place\xe2\x80\x9d You chased them down and said that, you are fucking brutal '
b"I accidentally dine and dashed once.\n\nWent to dinner with a group of friends. Got to talking, and we left.\n\nIt was almost fifteen minutes down the road that we realized WE DIDN'T PAY.\n\nWe went back to pay. The cops walked in to take a statement and found us paying and apologizing.\n\nThere were 8 of us, all but me buff guys. It was a big tab.\n\nCops had a laugh about it, so did our regular waitress. (we ate there every Wednesday.) "
b'I get this completely! I had a table that complained about everything just so management would discount their check. It was so infuriating to me when management did. These people are being ass holes and complaining about non issues. They\xe2\x80\x99re definitely going to stiff me. DON\xe2\x80\x99T help them and give them a discount. \n\nEven when I know I\xe2\x80\x99m getting stiffed, idc as long as the guest isn\xe2\x80\x99t winning. '
b'I understand not wanting to let them get away with being assholes, but running after the dude was fucking dumb. Now I understand that in some places, bartenders or serving staff have to pay for the shit people skip out on, but doing shit like that is a good way to get hurt or killed. People do kill for far less.'
b"If I was your manager I'd give you a tip out of the $63 for running them down."
b'I was working at a gas station in my younger years. One day I\'m slammed during rush hour traffic with a long line of people. A guy comes in grabs a couple sodas and waits in line to pay for his $30 in fuel. Gets up to the front of the line gets out his wallet "Shit I left my money in the car, I\'ll go grab the cash and be right back. I\'ll leave my wallet right here." and out the door he goes. I\'m busy so I don\'t try to argue about leaving the sodas, I\'ve got his wallet right here on the counter. Things die down and there is his wallet, I pick it up and there is nothing but Campbell\'s soup labels in there. I kept the wallet and used it for a little while, I had to at least get something out of buying this dude\'s gas.'
b'All the managers go above and beyond at the restaurant i work at. I work at a quality seafood buffet where things can get pretty expensive. 90$ after tax for just the buffet and waters. If we catch anyone trying to run out on their tab, we yell for a manager across a busy room and point to the scum bags. The managers usually go full sprint after them into the parking lot. Most of the time they\xe2\x80\x99re able to block the car from backing out or moving in general. Cops are called during all of this and the perps are forced to pay their tab. Best part is when we bring them back inside to pay it, the managers put on 15-20% gratuity depending on how much of an asshole they are, then have them sign it. '
b'Must be tough to be in the middle of doing 8 things at once, when a buzzer goes off and people frantically "need to pay right now to go to their table." That would drive me nuts. It\'s a shame they don\'t just transfer it and figure it out with tips somehow. I guess you\'ve all thought about that before and decided that how you do it is best, it just must kind of suck, and adds an extra hectic level to working your own section top to bottom.'
b'good for you op, doubt if they will go back to your place'
b'Good on you!!! I seriously am proud of what you did. And any assholes that give you shit for doing the right thing are the same assholes that stand by recording on their phones while shit is going down. Fuck that noise!! And fuck those dickheads for trying to steal!!'
b'People keep saying \xe2\x80\x9cwow it was so dangerous to follow those scary dine and dashers\xe2\x80\x9d but I\xe2\x80\x99m going to go out on a limb here and say that 99.99% of people who have ever dine and dashed and were caught did not react violently.\n\nOur society\xe2\x80\x99s tendency towards fear mongering is really annoying at times. Like how those news stations were saying how dangerous Pok\xc3\xa9mon Go was and acting like 99% of people playing it were kid nappers and rapists.\n\nI also find it funny how people keep being assholes and putting people who don\xe2\x80\x99t make a lot of money an hour down but are so deeply concerned for their physical well being\n\n'
b'A kid in our senior high school trip didn\xe2\x80\x99t have enough money for his food and decided to just not pay and walk out when the group left hoping he could slip away unnoticed. Nope. Waiter chased us down the block pissed as hell and holding his slip. Guy yelling in his face and he was just staring back, saying nothing. Guy finally says \xe2\x80\x9cfuck off kid!\xe2\x80\x9d And leaves muttering and flipping the world off. Kid just shrugged it off and said \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t have enough money.\xe2\x80\x9d The server scared the shit out of everyone and working at a restaurant at the time I felt for the waiter, and for god sakes ask if you can be spotted a few bucks.  '
b"Would have been better to let the drive off instead of telling them to come back in. You knew you weren't getting a tip even if they paid so might as well fuck them with an arrest.\n\nI understand it was heat of the moment though."
b"dude...don't risk your physical integrity for a place that won't give a shit if something happens to you...I can't remember how many times I paid out of pocket when someone dine and dash and the place I did this at still treated me as a fucking thief because the GM is a fucking imbecile who can't understand the paperwork from the fucking ancient system he had running in his piece of shit hotel."
b"You asked. That's all you can do. If they die from their own stupid choices, then they killed themselves, and you are not at fault."
b'I worked at a HuHot and his stupid bitch was trying to either steal attention from her daughter or something else and proclaimed that she ALSO was allergic to nuts. No problem! Scrape the shit out of the spot next to her daughters and get ready to put her food on the grill and thank fucking god I looked at her bowls twice. "Ma\'am you have black Thai peanut sauce in here." I made sure not to give her an allergen space next time, and she didn\'t ask, and I made sure to move her food further away from her daughters. Some people are just fucking stupid.'
b'Guest: what kind of animal is a lamb?\n\nMe: A baby sheep... it goes "baa-aa".\n\n\nGuest (to her friend): What\'s brooshetty (trying to say bruschetta)\n\nFriend: You know, it\'s that bread with brooshetty on top.\n\nGuest: Oh yeah!\n\nMe: *facepalm*\n\n\nHad a guest who worked as a server at the same restaurant but different location ask if he could get 5 grilled shrimp instead of the veggies that came with his dish. He acted like I was too stupid to make a simple substitution in the Micros and tried to explain how it could be done. I know how to sub out things bro, I just won\'t give you 5 shrimp in place of  vegetables.\n\n"Is [insert dish name here] enough to share?" \nI hate that question. Like, how hungry are you and how much can you eat? I don\'t know you.\n\n\n'
b'When I worked at a a nice bistro a very atrocious lady took twenty minutes of my time to explain to me that I should tell the chef to cook with less garlic. I live in a city with SO MANY restaurants... go and find one you like lady. '
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWings are NEVER fried. Anywhere else we go, they don\xe2\x80\x99t fry their buffalo wings\xe2\x80\x9d '
b'"What\'s the weather on the deck?" I looked up and down, said "we\'re on the deck."'
b'I need to order something gluten free to go for my girlfriend - wheat bread, does that have gluten in it?'
b'From when I worked at an ice cream shop: "What\'s the difference between the caramel sauce and the hot caramel sauce?" \n\nI\'ve been a barista for a few years now and people order "no foam cappuccinos" all the time, which is easy to make, I guess, but mystifying. \n\nThis is a tangent but we also have a ton of people ordering macchiatos but expecting caramel macchiatos, and get mad when they get their drink. No shade on anyone who likes a sugary drinks, I like them too, but caramel macchiatos are a Starbucks invention, not a standard drink in all cafes...'
b'What a bunch of idiots. If they wanted alcohol that badly, the over 21 yr old could just go to a store and buy some and then they could go drink in a back alley somewhere. '
b'How dare you not break the law to give the man what he wanted. I mean he didn\xe2\x80\x99t want the beer when it was legal, it\xe2\x80\x99s only fun when you\xe2\x80\x99re harassing someone and causing trouble. Seriously though dude should\xe2\x80\x99ve been paying better attention to what time it was. '
b'That sucks. I would have put my foot down and just said \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s not safe for children or adults. If you\xe2\x80\x99d like, I can bring one of each over and they can pick from the table but it\xe2\x80\x99s going to take a minute\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nI\xe2\x80\x99m all for teaching kids to make choices and all that but not like that.'
b'Please tell me you write in your spare time. This was a pleasure to read. Except for the poop part, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll take it because it was your inspiration. '
b'Those people suck. I\xe2\x80\x99m a flight attendant, but used to be a server for 7 years so when I go out to eat I go out of my way to make my servers life easier, honestly I think if my food was taking an hour to come out and I can see it was a busy night I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say a word. Your manager should have called the restaurant they worked at and let their manager know what their employees were acting like at another restaurant.'
b'Your manager sounds like a total bellhat.  What a fucking douche.  I hate snivelling management like that, sucking up to avoid bad reviews and giving entitled dicks free shit.  This is why idiots like them do this coz they get away with it!! You deserved to have your manager have your back,  OP, fuck them to the moon and back, they suck.'
b'Why were you written up for a walk out? How is that your fault? '
b'Find a new job ASAP. This is a load of it. '
b'I was literally following security prompts for when someone uses a check for the first time at a major retailer I worked out. The woman told my manager I made her feel like a criminal so I got a write up. I literally told her it was standard procedure and that we do it for everyone. \n\nGuilty conscience I guess'
b'People like this make me want to rip my hair out. I\xe2\x80\x99ve had little kids steal my pens outta my apron and bang them onto the table and break them. Then their parents throw the remains onto the floor for me to sweep up later. \nI hope you got your necklace fixed! \n'
b"I almost always ask for a box but I don't think I've ever made a gesture.  But perhaps I'm weird.  \n\nActually, I've never seen someone make a gesture like that but haven't ever looked for it -- if I now get in trouble for starting at other diners it'll be your fault!"
b'Lol, I admit to making a lot of hand gestures because my voice doesn\xe2\x80\x99t carry very well, especially with any kind of background noise '
b'You and your coworker are much better off not working in that crappy place but since your coworker was fired anyway, she should have called the police and pressed charges (it does not matter if she does not call the police on the same day.) You can still do this. Then if she had extra time, she should try seeing if an attorney would take her case for a hostile work environment. Some lawyers work on contingency so she would not even have to pay the lawyer if they lost the case (assuming a lawyer was willing to take a case.) '
b'I really feel like this isn\xe2\x80\x99t the entire story. Any manager in their right mind would have fired the cook for assaulting a coworker just to save face, if nothing else.'
b"The main skills you need as a server IMO are people skills and knowing how to work fast and efficiently. As long as you can do that and aren't a complete airhead you should be fine. As far as chains go  I'm not really sure on how well they make out at the end of a night. Most places like that only allow a small handful of tables at a time and obviously the more tables you have the more money you will make.\n\nI would suggest trying out a popular local place."
b"Keep in mind that most hotels offer full benefits to all employees.  Most restaurants that aren't in hotels offer shit for benefits.  You should look at trying to be a server in a hotel if you want to keep those benefits."
b"> I took the \xc2\xa390 and paid off their \xc2\xa360 bill and kept the rest for my inconvenience.\n\nAnd what gives you the right to steal? You're not better than they were, the only difference is you succeeded committing your crime.\n\nMakes me think about the positive side of Brexit."
b"I work w/ bartenders who ask what we made & ask why certain servers only tipped them out X amount. We're supposed to tip out 10% of bar sales. Some just let it go, but when people feel like they're being shorted money, I think they have every right to call the person out for it. The servers would complain if a table tipped them shitty, why do they think they can do that to bartenders?"
b'I serve and bartend at my restaurant. We are supposed to tip out like 5% of total sales (it changed from 10% of bar sales, because at other locations the bartender also makes desserts/espresso drinks, even though our locations bartenders only make alcoholic drinks and serve their customers)  This is kind of beside your point, but we have this one bartender. And it infuriates me to give her my money. She works shifts that I typically dont have people drinking, so she\'ll make like a mimosa and pour a beer for me, if she even gets to it cause shes too busy running her mouth to worry about literally half of her job description. Then comes around to everyone mid shift and the end of the night "can I get my tipout?" Like please tell me why I should pay her 5 dollars for making 1 of the drinks I rang in, when I had to wait so long to get it, they think I forgot about their drink to begin with? Its bullshit, and so I regularly skimp her on her tipout. And for the record, when I\'m on bar, of I didn\'t do anything for you bar related, I feel you have no reason to tip me out. '
b'Worked places with all different formats.  \nSmaller place I work is more casual, \xe2\x80\x98here\xe2\x80\x99s your tipout\xe2\x80\x99 and hand me some money, if I outsold them by a lot maybe a bar heavy night I turn it down. \nTwo larger places I worked with lots of staff had more measures in place, in one tipout was taken out as part of our cashout and distributed by managers.  The other place servers had to come up to the bartender hand us the money but we had to sign beside the bar sales portion of their cash out to indicate we saw it and got the right amount.'
b'I look at my sales, if I do 30 in bar in tip 3, unless its been a crazy hectic night and my tables just didnt feel like drinking, but the bar was packed, then they get more. If its a slow day and I do 40 in alco, I tip 4 bucks. If its been a crazy night for bar and me and I do 50 I tip 6-7. If it was like full on busy crazy and I do 200 in alch sales and bartender had to bust their ass, they get 25+. The grind is real. I benefit from the drink sales, you make them while serving, you should get money. '
b'I was I  the weeds last night in dreamland and somebody asked me for a coffee pizza. And I brought the pizza chef ice.'
b'Hahaha!  I posted something similar a long time ago.  That server mind stays in your blood!!'
b"I bet that action meant the world to both of them. Good on you for doing your part to make a dark day just a touch brighter, OP.\n\nIt's so easy to get bogged down in all the assholes and bullshit, and to miss these little, pivotal moments. Thank you for taking the time to lighten the load of their pain.\n\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I have to clean all these onions from my eyes."
b'That is completely off base on the part of that customer. Anytime I have ever used a coupon, Groupon or otherwise, you leave it based on the actual value of the meal. I\xe2\x80\x99m so sorry. '
b"It sounds like you have a wonderful work environment where your opinion is valued.  Would you feel comfortable approaching one of the manager/owners or the head server about your concerns?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI bet Ol' Breyden there won't be around too long anyway, soooo many red flags."
b'Wow, not all heros wear capes. Fuck Karen. '
b'Ugh you have great patience and stamina, and I\xe2\x80\x99m so glad they gave 20%! I was afraid this story would end with no tip lol. We had a table in the bar last night tip $16 on a $205 tab. That\xe2\x80\x99s right, 8%! Woohoo President\xe2\x80\x99s Day Weekend folks! '
b'I am so glad you were tipped, I had an 8 top, same way, no fucking tip. Not even a penny slid on their table with a $500+ bill (this was a few years ago). We are supposed (per laws) to charge automatic gratuity over 6 people but the head waitress wanted to gamble on their generosity (illegal but I quit very shortly after because my tips were not matching my effort for this exact reason). We lost that gamble more often than not. Used to make me so mad.'
b"Thank you everyone! I apologize for the excessive curse words and drama, I was still just so fired up! \n\nIt was getting to be a long post so I left out some small details: we were, indeed short handed that night. There was an incident with 'drop and go' near the bus station where one manager was telling me not to, and the dishwasher said to because of stacking issues. A silly mixup that turned my face red so I just hushed up, it should have been a non issue at that moment in time. \n\nThe entire restaurant was also slammed with tight turns and reservations all evening so we were all stressed. That triple seating thing I told you about? It happened twice during the 3+ hour stay of the big top. \n\nThanks for all the kind words you guys, I slept great! No nightmares. :) I know this particular set of organizational and multitasking skills will come in handy when I start teaching this next block so I am grateful for that. Somehow feel children will be easier than adults though? Haha\n\nAnd THANK YOU mod for understanding my dramatic need for flare after a night like that. \n\nThank you to the stranger who awarded me my first gold!!"
b"at first the bacardi comment seemed excessive but by the end of this well (written story)   it wouldn't have been enough.  I hope Karen and Jeff become a couple."
b'At least the tip was proper. Small place I work did 7200 in sales this past Saturday my ring was just over 1700 at the bar and I walked with 165. I am the head bartender and get tipped out from servers as well. That total was with everything tipped out. I am in the process of moving on from this shitshow of trash people. Like motherfucker I have worked for years to make you the \xe2\x80\x9cgreatest drink\xe2\x80\x9d you have ever had and you just tipped 3 dollars on a 72 dollar drink tab. Whole building of karens and donnys. '
b"Wow. I'm not a server. I just like restaurants and read this to see what you folks go through. I used to work public service and people can be wonderful or ridiculous. Sorry you suffered through that."
b"You make me ***so*** glad I gave my bartender/waitress $10 cash on our $34 bill last night ....she's awesome, and we love her !"
b'This reminds me of the time I was hosting on mothers day and an 18 top showed up, no reservation. I was about to to turn them away but then the manager strikes. \n\nHe says that the server who just clocked in will take them, the server agreed because he thought hed get a good tip out of it. He was wrong.\n\nHe had an 18 top.. of 5, 4 top booths. They stayed for 4 hours and took up his entire section for nearly his entire shift. \n\nHe ran himself ragged getting apps, drinks, whatever. They even called the manager and told him how impressed and amazing his service was. The server told me he was looking forward to a decent tip. \n\nThey finally leave and he checks the bills (all split of course) \n\nNothing. Not one of the probably 7 or so checks. They wrote "Bless you" on the back of every check.\n\nHe wasnt tipped a single dime. \n\nHe cried in the back room and had to go home.'
b'I made it to the part about the birthday sash and knew you were in for hell'
b'This made my eye twitch. So much like my last job. Glad you survived!'
b'I used to work backstage for theatre shows, and let me tell you: confetti is the WORST. I\xe2\x80\x99m still finding gold confetti around my house from a show I did five years ago. Reading this hurt me. '
b"> and my bartender would appreciate it if I could ring in those old fashioneds and hot toddies all at once instead of one every 5 minutes.\n\nHaha.  One can always dream. \n\nMy friends are pretty decent diners but even they are bad about that.  One will have like 2 inch of swill left and won't think to order another now.  Regardless of prompting from the server.  I'll usually encourage it.\n\nEven on the river tubing trip I go on every year, this happens.  Once I was in the beer canoe . This was before most upgraded to buying floatable coolers and kept beers and empties in Walmart bags.\n\n At one point, between stops , I rowed backwards and handed out beers to people in their tubes and took their empties.  \n\nJust as the river takes me much furthur ahead but still within shouting distance, the idiot of the group shouts that he wants a beer.  I literally was  just near him 3 minutes earlier and now he wants me to fight against the current for 5 minutes because he has wet brain.\n\nIt's in their best interest to ask what you want ahead of time because things take time .  But normally intelligent people who can be really good at planning for the future by saving, investing or bargain shopping can lose all sense of that when leisure time comes around."
b'You\xe2\x80\x99re a bad ass. An absolute titan. Many people have shut down in less stressful situations. I\xe2\x80\x99m brimming with pride and joy. You\xe2\x80\x99re fantastic! '
b'Oh man, reading this gave me secondhand anxiety. You\xe2\x80\x99re a better person that I am for being to handle that! '
b'I was worried you were going to say and then someone started to throw glitter at the end of the meal. I have read that sentence in horror in here before. Confetti is evil in its own right, but glitter is toxic waste in a restaurant.'
b"You got my full respect. I'm doing this job since 11 years & I'm done \xf0\x9f\x98\x82\nI feel like people think we're their slaves & they can do whatever they want.\nI love my job & it's the most important thing to me but sometimes I just wanna smash some heads against the wall \xf0\x9f\xa4\xab"
b'Uff.\nThanks for sharing all that. \nIf it helps I would never mention we\xe2\x80\x99re celebrating a birthday, let alone expect staff to sing. \n\nEven when I have asked NOT to do the cheesy birthday thing someone in the group thinks they will be the one to surprise me and I will be so pleased. \n\nNow I will not go in a restaurant with friends anytime my birthday rolls around. \n\nThis might make me sound about as fun as a wet blanket but I just prefer other experiences to feel like I am celebrating.  '
b'I work in a cafe that does coffee and pancakes mostly. It really grinds my gears when customers wait until after they have consumed the product to complain about something that I could have easily fixed earlier. (i.e. pancakes too dry and need more syrup)\n\nIn these situations I just put on my customer service voice and kindly let them know that I can help them next time if they tell me that a problem exists earlier.\n\nAnyways, I definitely feel your pain.'
b'I was raised to not make a fuss. One day I ordered a carbonara at a fancy cafe/restaurant, it was salty as fuck whenever I had some of their in-house bacon in the mouthful. It was like eating a teaspoon of salt. I I kinda just left the bacon and after I paid I let them know it was over seasoned but otherwise a beautiful dish. When not eating the bacon it was a delicious meal. I explained that. \n\nI didn\xe2\x80\x99t need a discount, I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t upset. Just figured I\xe2\x80\x99d say something to let the kitchen know ease up in the salt or their bacon batch was not the best. But my goodness it still haunts me that I bothered to say anything. Had someone checked in during my meal I would have said something sooner, but I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to go looking for someone to just complain to. Paying was the only time I saw someone once the meal was dropped off. '
b"Ahem. Sometimes, I tell people if there is something wrong so they can fix it for future customers. I don't want a discount or refund, I just thought you might like to know there is a problem so it can be addressed. In this case, maybe he just thought the crepes should come with more jam."
b'Some fish does taste more fishy than others. I can only eat a few types of fish because I hate the really fishy ones. '
b'my cat is very catty. my ears are very eerie. my bell is very belly. I hate people, is all I can say.'
b'Tricky one because you could take the easy option and say \xe2\x80\x9csorry I\xe2\x80\x99ll get you a fresh one\xe2\x80\x9d but that would be admitting fault when it isn\xe2\x80\x99t your fault, however calling a customer a liar is never gonna go down well lol hope your next shift is better x'
b'I mean, you really didn\xe2\x80\x99t give enough info to tell. Did you consistently not run your food? Not buss your tables? What? '
b"They sound like childish coworkers, which makes it sound like it's a them problem. So don't take it to heart.\n\nAs my brother would say, that sounds like a personal problem and I personally don't care.\n\nIf you enjoy serving, go for it and if you continue to have childish coworkers and you know your boss genuinely likes you then you can absolutely confide in him with what you've been dealing with, especially if you are working at a big chain restaurant as you and your coworkers are always on camera and all your boss would have to do to see if what you're saying is true is to just pull up the camera feed from that time frame and just let your coworkers dig themselves into a hole."
b"I'm not saying this applies to you, but I have worked in places where bosses like/reward the wrong people while other members of staff get increasingly frustrated by other people's performance. If you decide to go back into serving and a similar thing happens, I would ask your co-workers. If it's just bullshit they won't be able to give you an answer, but if they have a genuine complaint to make then why not take it on board? They certainly could do it in a more professional way than it sounds like your previous coworkers did, but if you like the job and want to do well then feedback isn't something to be afraid of and if there is a problem and you listen to it and act on it then it will make you look even better to bosses/other coworkers. "
b'Nah if your manager liked you and wanted you behind the bar, they were probably just jealous. I see similar behavior by the long time servers at my restaurant towards the new servers who just started and are better than them.'
b'Put a scoop of protein powder into a glass of water and give it to her next time. '
b'Water with a side of wheat grass juice. GTFO. Or here, take this nice glass of water and a tablespoon of peanut butter. The fuck.  \n\n\nWhat did you end up offering?'
b"What?? Was she talking about an alcoholic drink?? It's not going to be keto friendly because all alcohol is full of simple carbohydrates. Same for low sugar, even if you don't add simple syrup or anything, all alcohol will cause a spike in blood sugar. That's a part of  why people get hungry after  drinking for a bit. Blood sugar climbs and then drops. IDK about gluten free, some liquors are made with grain. But high protein? Maybe an old fashioned shaken with eggwhite. But that also needs a sugar cube to balance the lemon juice.\n\nFact is nothing would check those boxes and also taste good."
b"I honestly don't understand how lazy people can be. So I have a few restrictions, but they are all by choice, so I research BEFORE I even step into the restaurant. It's not hard if it's a chain, and if it isn't a chain... well, different types of restaurants still tend to serve the same things. Don't freaking CHOOSE to make server's lives harder just because you don't understand what you are CHOOSING to limit yourself from."
b"I only make a big deal with the foods that can kill me, which is any kind of fish and sunflower seeds.   \nSalad bars scare me, because I have to ask if there are sunflower seeds in stuff. And they're usually right next to bacon bits, so that has to be done carefully.   \n\n\nOrdering fried chicken or other fried foods, I have to be specific that it not be cooked in the same fryer as catfish, shrimp, etc. Same thing with Hibachi grill.   \n"
b"In that situation, the server should have said nothing and silently kept shaking her head when questioned about the dish.\n\nThey either would've gotten the message or not."
b'The server really is at fault here though. When someone avoids a certain food or has an allergy and they ask if you have an option without that item and they say yes and you order - the customer is assuming that request will be taken into account.  I order food without cheese all the time and it still ends up coming out with cheese on it because the server just flat out forgets to put in the modification or check before bringing it out. People are busy but mistakes do happen a lot. '
b"Accidentally consuming meat doesn't make you not a vegetarian anymore. I would have been super upset if the same thing happened to me, but I also make sure to check ten times that I'm ordering something meatless. I once ordered a bean burrito and took a bite before I realized it was beef...doesn't mean I'm not vegan."
b'How is it her fault in your view? She specifically asked if the spaghetti sauce had meat in it and you told her "no meat". \nI\'d be disgusted and furious too\n\nThe part about wanting to slap her with a steak seriously makes me question why you\'re a vegetarian. Can\'t be out of compassion for the animals. '
b'SOBBING HYSTERICALLY and repeating how she "felt the meat slide down her throat" (ew, phrasing)\n\nThis is comedy gold.  Sounds like an old Phil Hendrie bit.'
b'Thank you for an excellent post. I realize it\xe2\x80\x99s been a rough time recently with all the Vday horrors, but there have been an uptick up posts about customers making servers cry. I want to give those people hugs and ask them if they are okay. '
b'So give her a glass with vodka, Worcestershire sauce, Tabasco, and lime juice.  Easy peasy.'
b"Our restaurant *does* have a baby changing station.  Want to know where this woman decided to change her baby today? On an empty table next to her, right next to where the kitchen/expo line is. This isn't even the first time. "
b'"Thanks for asking, but no thank you" (or just no thank you)\n\n"I\'m not interested in a relationship, thanks though"\n\nAnd probably separate yourself from talking at that point honestly.'
b"I would have kindly asked him to leave as soon as he touched my broom. \n\nPeople don't do nice things just to be a nice human being, payment is always expected. \n\nI learned this after my first trip to New Orleans. I let an older man put a string of beads on me and a couple friends, thinking it was just in the spirit of the town. ***Wrong***. When i told him I had no money after he demanded a tip, he promptly **ripped** the beads off of me. \n\nI hope things get better OP. I hate people like that. "
b'Can you imagine being her friend? "I took it upon myself to do your laundry now give me your antique china I DESERVE it"\n\nPick the chocolate out. What. The. Ever. Loving. Fuck.  '
b'This is the mess you get when you welcome families & more so when you offer discounts on children\'s meals.\n\nYou get the absolute worst of every situation-  cheap & demanding people, uncaring/inattentive parents that let their kids run riot, the child sounds & smells, everyone that doesn\'t have kids is upset & tips shitty, and last & worst of all- the horrible mess.\n\nI will not knowingly set foot into a restaurant that has "kids eat free" or a "kids menu" simply because I didn\'t have kids & don\'t want to deal with anyone else\'s.'
b'He sounds like he either has severe ocd or autism maybe. Either way, not your fault'
b'Total load of BS.'
b'\\---part 2---\n\n&#x200B;\n\nnow,...   everyone is screaming,  jocks-a-laughing,.   everyone is drenched in beer...  and mike slowly comes in..\n\n&#x200B;\n\nmike grabs the first 2 jocks he finds from behind by their belts.   he lifts them off their seats,  and slowly takes them out opening the door with their heads, and throws them outside screaming at the top of his lungs (i\'m romancing) YOU COME BACK,  I CRUSH YOU!\n\nmike comes back inside..  now the other jocks in there are getting ready for a fight.  mike doesn\'t give a shit..  he grabs the first 2 belts he finds..  these guys are weakly trying to fight,  mike doesn\'t give  shit.  he takes them out of the bar as well...   and he screams again, while the first 2 ones are getting up....\n\nYOU COME BACK,  I CRUSH YOU!!!  (bad translation again but you get the point).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMike gets back in.  his face looks like a pummeled apple but he doesn\'t give a shit.  he looks at the last pieces of trash in there..  and asks:  "you choose how you get out of here".\n\n&#x200B;\n\nthey all left.  (some of them even leaving backpacks and stuff in there)...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMike actually spent the rest of the evening drinking water and apologising about what happened to everyone...  he called for an all-around round for everyone.   he kept coming every now and then and was always acclaimed as a hero.\n\nfrom that day,  (and for the 6 months i was working there) the history got known...  and when fuckheads started trying to fuck shit up..  there were always ppl,  either regular or other jocks to tell them \'chill out..  you don\'T want Mike to take care of this\'.\n\nit even got so much known that waitresses were saying " don\'t do anything stupid,  you don\'t want me to call Mike in here".\n\n&#x200B;\n\ni wish i could find this guy again today,   just so i could thank him,  and hope he could still hug me and spin me like a princess.....\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT:   Mike never landed a punch or anything..  he just grabbed ppl by the belt while himself taking punches and threw ppl out.  i\'m pretty sure if he punched or hitted anyone it would have resulted in severe trauma for the reciever.  but that guy was just a passive \'don\'t fuck with my ppl\' type of guy.'
b'I had a "Mike" that managed our sister restaurant. Big guy who was strong as an ox, but was by far the nicest guy you could ever meet. We always laughed about the way he could WWF someone, literally lift them above his head and spin them around, always done in fun.      \n\nAnd we could always count on him to diffuse an ugly situation. The guy was a wall, you couldn\'t move him.   \n\nSadly, he was taken out by an extremely drunk driver on a sunny day when he was out riding his motorcycle for pleasure. \n\n&#x200B;'
b'My best bud is a Mike type. 6\'8", and huge. Calm as can be and very friendly. Worked as a bouncer for a bit. Would regularly have drunk guys try to challenge him, and fail. Often hilariously. Arms so long and big, he hardly had to do anything other than stiff-arm them until they gave up or fell over. Real sweetheart.'
b'I used to wait tables full time and work at a very popular pet store chain part time for extra cash and the combination used to give me the WEIRDEST server nightmares. I vividly remember one where I was slammed with no shoes on and I had a table of lizards (dressed like people in like a dress and a suit and tie). They call me to complain about their food. Fella lizard screams at me, \xe2\x80\x9c There\xe2\x80\x99s a fly in my wife\xe2\x80\x99s soup! Where is my fly?!\xe2\x80\x9d And I immediately apologize and start searching for more flies and then wake up. '
b'For a few months I had these server nightmares every single night, even to the point where I\xe2\x80\x99d be half asleep convinced that tables had been seated in my living room. One day I woke up so tired after a night of those dreams and cried because I thought I was losing my mind, so I started smoking pot before bed and now I rarely have those dreams. When you work late shifts and then have early morning classes every minute of sleep is crucial. '
b'Yes!!!! You are not alone. I think this is why so many of us have alcohol problems. \n\nLately this only happens to me if I go straight to sleep when I get home with out two hours of wind down time.\n\nI recently had a stress dream that was so vivid that I am still getting flash backs. '
b'I still have dreams about the place I worked at 20 years ago. Those aren\xe2\x80\x99t bad. The places I\xe2\x80\x99ve worked in the last 10 years, yeah, those suck. They never go away. I do like how the places meld together, so it\xe2\x80\x99s one place, but it has other places mixed in. Maybe I\xe2\x80\x99m weird.'
b'I\xe2\x80\x99m always in the kitchen, but it\xe2\x80\x99s the menu for the other place I worked at. Or the customer has just ordered something completely off the wall, and the boss has assured them that they can have it. I hate that one.'
b'It seems like a place with 3 table sections and polishing cutlery for running side work and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure some other simple tasks will not take multiple weeks of shadowing.  Just grind out the next few shifts and get your own section and then jump on the wagon with everyone else about how shitty she is and just go out there and made that $$.     If you\xe2\x80\x99re ready,  which I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you\xe2\x80\x99re ready,  ask your manager to put you on the floor already.    Good luck!'
b'I had to "train" for a week at my current job despite having years of serving experience too. Super frustrating as I and everyone else on the floor knew I was ready. However, putting pressure on your GM at this stage in the game isn\'t a good idea, you\'re just going to have to grin and bear it. You don\'t want to look like you think you are better than anyone. If you are better than her, it will show, and quickly. You don\'t need to vocalize it, and doing so will only make you look like the entitled lazy one.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat I did was start doing everything I could for the table, and relegating the server training me to a notepad and voicebox, essentially. I refilled waters, bussed, ran all the food and drinks, remembered their extra sides of dressing, prepared desserts, got their bill into the servers hands so she could drop it off when it was time, and answered any questions the table happened to ask me. That way, whenever anybody saw me I was doing something server-ly. Doing this I escaped my fellow trainee by a whole week. I also studied the menu obsessively in my abundant downtime, since for some reason management always seems to think that your knowledge of the menu is the main metric for whether you are ready to serve or not. '
b'I\xe2\x80\x99ve been in kind of the reverse role where I was training someone with just barely less experience than I have although she was a bit older than me so it was strange. For her \xe2\x80\x9ctraining\xe2\x80\x9d though, I mainly made sure to explain how things run at this restaurant that may be different than others and take some getting used to. Also knowing what questions to ask about which dishes and what beer to recommend (it\xe2\x80\x99s a brewhouse but she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t tried any of the beer yet). \nMaybe you could learn some of the things that set that restaurant apart from the other one you worked at from chatting with the other servers when there\xe2\x80\x99s time. Since you already know how to talk to customers and have the ability to read the menu, the more anecdotal training from others who have spent time working there could be the most useful training. '
b'I agree with the majority here. That is too long to train for an experienced server (maybe even host moving up) and just go along with it. If the money is good and you like your customers it will feel worth it. Also, this is a good chance to be on good terms with your coworkers. Bust your ass and show everyone what a good server does. '
b'The place I work at only has 3 table sections, however, if you show aptitude, engage in a dialogue with management. Tell them you feel like you are ready and then demonstrate it-- I did a "practice run" and served management two days before Vday. Wednesday I asked for a 3 table section for my shift. Vday I had a 3 table section (such moneys) and have had 3 since then even though I wasnt due to have 3 tables for another week. Communication is key, which I think you  know based on your post and being a server. Talk to them. '
b'Was probably all part of the plan to get $200 of free food.'
b"When you're so fucked you can't even go to dinner without getting arrested. "
b"I was once at an Applebee's and ordered chicken tenders and fries as I just assumed that would be the absolute easiest fucking thing to make in the world. My server was pleasant.\n\nThe food arrived and I bit into a chicken tender. It was still raw. Like gordon Ramsay would have said this thing could have laid an egg tomorrow raw. \n\nI've worked in the industry before, and know that mistakes can happen, although it isnt completely the food runners fault. The cook should have temped it, obviously didn't, and the breading wasn't ice cold, so the runner just trusted the expo and cook. Not his fault. But now I can't eat another bite of chicken, or anything that this place is going to serve me, just because my brain is telling me NO. I left a tip, and paid for the tenders.\n\nLooking back I should have asked for a double whiskey and have my tenders compd but I had just gotten out of a rough kitchen situation myself and had a bit of empathy for the people working.\n\nNot sure why I'm sharing this as it is in the complete opposite of the spectrum of OPs thread. "
b'But did they end up having to pay? '
b"Its great when the trash takes itself out isn't it?"
b'Oh.....my....god. That just seems too crazy to be true. Though maybe that\xe2\x80\x99s my mind hoping people aren\xe2\x80\x99t this terrible to another human being for doing their jobs. I\xe2\x80\x99m glad the manager gave her what she should have been dealt a long time ago. Your manager was karma! :D '
b'I fucking hate people like that'
b"Ive worked as a waiter a long time ago and i always tip good unless that person didnt give a shit. On a busy night I understand that timing will not be as good as when it's not busy so I never sweat or assume my table is being neglected. I had to teach my wife this because she thought she was a princess. People who think they are royalty at a restaurant can get fucked but I definitely appreciate someone who takes care of my table. "
b'I lean into This Bitch at the table.  \xe2\x80\x9cIs everything okay?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nDamn, that without context sounds like you were about to kill her. Even with context'
b'I love it when people threaten to call the police or "Never come here again!"  actually think we give a shit.   '
b"It's refreshing to hear about someone getting punished for that shit. Usually they just get away with free meals everywhere they go, this making it impossible for everyone else when something actually goes wrong. "
b'Apps after entrees?\nI can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine the look on your cooks face. If I would give up such an order our cook would ask me if this was a joke.'
b"When you know what's coming, what else is there to do but step out of the way? Good luck!"
b'Just remember to chase down dine n dashers Spartacus style'
b'that\xe2\x80\x99s disgusting i hope the police were involved. even if 17 is the age of consent in your state, being someone\xe2\x80\x99s boss makes them a power figure and you can go after them for that. '
b'I am glad they were great. The first part of the story made mrle growl so I am glad it ended well.'
b'If she thinks she could do better I would have handed her a fucking apron and been like get to work!'
b'Oh wow, I remember one.  Worked at a truck stop as a line cook years back.  This particular truck stop for some reason had gates to the entrance/exit that are almost always open, but can be closed to signify "No room left for trucks to park."  Now, this is also a very big truck stop, and the restaurant is good for the area, so we get a lot of car traffic too.  The restaurant is fairly deep into the parking area, but there\'s a full service 24x7 maintenance shop for the trucks right next to the gate entrance.\n\nOne of the waitresses suddenly yells out at a customer and friend who suddenly take off and run.  Manager sees it, and radios over to the shop to shut the gates ASAP.  Sure enough the gates were closed before the guys got away, and the rest of the parking lot is enclosed by fences, ditches, or other obstacles.  The cops had plenty of time to get there while these two idiots were driving around the parking lot at high speed trying to figure out a way out.'
b"The actual people doing the dine and dash weren't all that crazy, but the circumstance kind of is, for me anyways\n\nIm a server at a movie theater, one of the ones that have a full kitchen or bar. Back in October when Halloween came out i was scheduled to open that Saturday along with three other coworkers. Im usually one of the first people to show up because i live about 20 miles away and its takes me up to an hour and a half to get to work if traffic is terrible. Well as I wait for the doors to open after checking to make sure every theater was clean, only one of the three others scheduled showed up. Our GM was there and sent out messages to other two to remind them they worked today. They never did show up and so its me and someone we will call Slow Worker or SW (you'll see why later). So SW and I split up the theaters for our 10 ish hour shift. Our M1 (10-2ish) round goes fine as always, its usually slow and we dont get more then maybe 20 people for the building. Then M2 (2-5 ish) rolls around. we. Blow. Up. My side gets swarmed with people as i have three different movies seating in the same hour. I somehow manage to to stay on top of it and by the time im done the other side is getting hit. By this point a Key Holder has shown up to help and another Manager has come in. All i had left to do was wait on a cashtab in Nightschool and since they were the only people in there it shouldn't be to stressful, key word is shouldn't. Well while im waiting, KH comes up to me and to go help SW catch lights (you press a button to say you want to order) and help SW out. So i hop into the theater that was getting hit the hardest and start in the back and and work to the front of the room, SW was also in here taking someones order. I am flying though orders, getting everyone silverwear and napkins, running alcohol from the bar, due to the lack of 18yo runners, and food because we were understaffed that day, and after that SW is STILL at the same person he was at when i first got in there, even some of the other guests were asking me about what was going on. Well we continue and im running down to the other half of the building to help SW with lights and my own theaters cause it was that time when people needed refills on drinks. It was at this time i remembered that i still had a cash tab in NightSchool amd luckily the movie was still going, almost over, but still going. So i walk into the theater and i can already see that they are gone. Deep down i already knew they stiffed us, but i go check anyways to see if they left money in the book before leaving. Sure enough they didn't, and normally i just would have went outside and told KH or one of the managers what happened but im already frustrated that i have essentially been working an entire theater and this just set me over the edge. I screamed out loud and threw the book across the theater and it hits the wall with a loud thud (thank god this movie is loud). I then grab the book and sprint out to where one of the managers and KH were and asked if they saw a couple with a baby came through. They tell me they left about 30 minutes earlier (not long after i dropped the bill off)  and begin asking me what happened. I tell them that they stiffed and that i forgot to check on them earlier. They tell me its ok and that they'll take care of it, but im still livid that this happened. Our shit continues, one of the managers tries to bribe people to come in with free food (no one came) and M3 (5-7 ish) is just as busy, of not more. The people for E1 (6-11ish) come in and were also understaffed. I remained sour (except for when i was talking to customers) for the rest of the day. The only good thing about it was that i made $169 for the entire shift. I did wind up telling the KM and the same manager the next day about my freakout we laughed about it because they know im not really an angry person."
b'Do.Not.Do.It.\n\nIf you break up and still work together, it will be hell.\n\nNever date coworkers. Been there, done that. Every time it was awful.'
b'Oh man, so many people are telling you this is a bad idea and it can be for sure! However, people dating/sleeping with each other at restaurants happens. We spend a lot of time at work so dating 9-5ers can be hard. You really just have to decided how to handle it. Honestly, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have to be dramatic if you choose the right person with the expectation that if you do break up, you can remain professional. However that\xe2\x80\x99s a rarity, your coworkers will be nosy and asked you about it, and things could get dramatic. Keep the drama outside of work as much as you possibly can, try not to vent to your coworkers either. It\xe2\x80\x99s an easy trap to fall into that makes their lives really awkward. \n\nHere is a success story for you...\nMy (now) husband and I worked together for about 6 months before he asked me out. He asked me out for a drink after a particularly long shift under the guise that he had invited a few other coworkers. He was always extremely polite and barely flirted with me so I had no idea he had a huge crush on me. I however knew that I had a bit of a crush on him, but never thought anything would happened. So we went out for drinks a few times, and started to build a friendship with some obvious flirting. Finally one night he told me he had feelings for me. I was completely shocked, but delighted. We are now married and expecting our first baby in April! '
b'Yeah don\xe2\x80\x99t do it, I\xe2\x80\x99ve dated in my last 3 restaurants and it was THE BIGGEST MISTAKE '
b'I used to work with my boyfriend at a pizza place. He cooked, I served. I was in a manipulative relationship at the time that I quickly left once I got into a close friendship with my bf. We texted and hung out with mutual friends but nothing ever happened no matter how bad I wanted it to. Then one day he confided in our friend that he liked me and I waltzed up to him at work with a load of false confidence and said \xe2\x80\x9cI like you too\xe2\x80\x9d. It was completely out of context and unexpected for him, so he paused for a minute and then I smiled. We went on our first date to go see a classic movie night at our local theater (to see \xe2\x80\x9cjaws\xe2\x80\x9d which is my fave) a few weeks later. I went home that night and told my dad that I found the right boy.\n\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve since taken a management position and switched jobs, as well as started teaching, but we\xe2\x80\x99re still together and have been since that first date last year.\n\nWe\xe2\x80\x99re currently saving for our first home! \xe2\x9d\xa4\xef\xb8\x8f'
b'Don\xe2\x80\x99t. It will be uncomfortable for the rest of the staff whether you get turned down, or you become a couple, or when you break up. '
b'I am a career server. \nI have opened and trained in several multimillion dollar restaurants. \nI started washing dishes when I was 14. \nI am now 43. Married,  2kids(1 in college), 2 dogs and a home owner. \nI have been successful I\xe2\x80\x99m fine dining for over two decades and have been able to go and get a degree in Behavioral Science with emphasis in Organizational Leadership. \nI now head the Training and Development for our flagship store which clears around 10m annually. \n\nI believe that there have been rewarding times that I will never forget and experiences that were not only hilarious but gave me the ability to enjoy this industry immensely. The spectrum of people I know and can call on is amazing and I have enjoyed many perks from the array of lavish guests I have met. \n\nThe business is tough and not for everyone though. \n\nI have seen people break down crying and people quit in the middle of a $5000 dollar table because they were too nervous. \nIt may be true for some restaurants to \xe2\x80\x9cpool\xe2\x80\x9d tips but normally at the higher end places you tip out maybe 20% of your own sales and keep the rest. Every place is different but that will give you a general reference. \n\nWine knowledge always helps as I have my level 1  from the Court of Master Sommeliers and it definitely increases confidence and ability to sell high end wines. At my establishment we have wines that vary from $40 to $10k so it helps to know your shit. \n\nMoney can vary but if you are a hard worker and good with a lot of different type of personalities then do it and good luck!'
b'Really good servers have a certain set of skills. They are smart, multitaskers, customer service oriented, problem solvers and people pleasers. Your pay will never increase. It\xe2\x80\x99s a fabulous side gig, but as a main gig...not so much.  With that skill set, you might like dispatching. It\xe2\x80\x99s using many of the same skills. You help people. You solve problems. Work flow is varied and the job has variety.  \n\nI miss waiting tables. Do what makes you happy! \n\nJust be aware that fine dining with the higher checks you will split (pay out) more to co-workers - bus/dish/hosts. '
b'My friend made it the nicest restaurant in our city. He went through the interview process on three different occasions until he was actually hired. He was working at the most "famous" "most recommended" restaurant in our city for four years before transitioning into actual fine dining. Now he waits on NBA players, tech company, NFL, and makes over a grand easily in a night. His sales are regularly over 10k. The majority of servers are on-call and the top tier servers have private rooms and stable schedules.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe makes great money, doesn\'t have to work very often, can easily be able to travel, meets amazing people. He says servers never leave where hes at- they are all career servers. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMost fine dining at least where I am at is an added 18% gratuity so you are guaranteed not to be stiffed. All my friends in fine dining say it goes by head. Around 8 guests a servers. '
b'A familiar face who you know is going to be nice is the best thing in the world. My regulars always make my shifts better '
b'Stay away from apologizing as much as you can. Instead thank your guests for being patient or understanding. \n\nApologizing is a negitave.\nThanking is a positive.\n\nFor example, if you apologize for taking a while to drop my drinks off I\'m going to think about how slow you were and I might start keeping track but if you thank me for being patient I feel like a good little boy who is being rewarded for waiting. \n\nAlso I like to keep my guests well informed on what\'s happening.\n\n"Hey friends, see that 30 top over there? I tried getting your order in before theirs but they beat us to it. Food might take a little longer to come out but I got my eye on it. If you need anything just holler"'
b"Some people are just going to be rude. The hardest part for me is not letting rude people ruin my shift. \n\nAlso, be as helpful as you can afford to be to other servers when you're working. If people find you helpful and supportive, they'll be more willing to help and support you when you gave a 15 top and 4 other tables all needing attention. "
b"I work at a small fast casual chain. Kind of interesting finding these, they have to at least be 10 years old. It's funny since now we don't even give out coloring pages anymore. It's weird working at a place you always went to as a kid."
b'Did she at least take the diaper with her? \n\nUgh I had a table once who must have somehow changed the baby at the table without being noticed. Rather than getting up and tossing the diaper in the bathroom trash (the ladies room was 10 feet from their table AND had a separate changing room) they stuffed it in between the seat and the back of the booth for our busser. Good times.'
b'I work in a tiny, tiny restaurant. Ten tables and the \xe2\x80\x9ckitchen\xe2\x80\x9d is a corner of the area behind the bar top. Inventive hipster food, guests love the set up, etc etc. \n\nWe have two single use bathrooms, unfortunately no changing station. Mothers normally make do all right, though I realize it\xe2\x80\x99s not ideal and I really wish my manager would stop being so cheap and buy one. She is a mother so you\xe2\x80\x99d think she\xe2\x80\x99d know better but whatever. \n\nI wasn\xe2\x80\x99t working this day, but one busy Sunday brunch our quietest, least confrontational cook walks into the back room (also tiny, but that\xe2\x80\x99s where we squeeze a cooler, chest freezer, and dry storage) and sees A COUPLE IN OUR BACKROOM CHANGING THEIR BABIES DIAPER ON THE CHEST FREEZER. Apparently they told the cook they\xe2\x80\x99d just be a minute while he stared dumbfounded, and he just backed away in shock. I just can\xe2\x80\x99t even imagine what ran through their heads as they opened an employees only door and decided that the place we keep the food they are about to eat!!! is the perfect place to change a fucking diaper. I only wish I\xe2\x80\x99d been there so I could have one of the few chances we get in this industry to chew a shitty guest out. '
b"I once changed my daughter on a restaurant booth bench... However that was after discovering they had no changing table. I don't remember where we were but it wasn't a fancy place you wouldn't time out the possibility of babies. I did however take the diaper with me and even though I knew no messes were made whipped the cushion with baby wipes.\n\nAlso on a related note more than one restaurant my wife and I went to had a changing station in the ladies room but not the men's room... I head to bring my daughter heck to my wife and have her do it. But what if I wasn't with her? It was very frustrating and I did complain about it. Though I don't think the configuration the one bathroom would even allow for one to be installed."
b'The phrase tube steak never ceases to be shocking. I have a tube steak story too. \n\nI worked in a video store during high school and my older coworker got cut early one night. On her way out she says \xe2\x80\x9cguess what I\xe2\x80\x99m having for dinner tonight? Tube steak smothered in underwear.\xe2\x80\x9d That kind of thing really sticks with you when you are 15. \n\nFast forward ~15 years and I\xe2\x80\x99m serving in a pretty nice restaurant and our special is \xe2\x80\x9csomething smothered in something.\xe2\x80\x9d I go to a table with a couple about my age and when I start to say the special, I get to the word \xe2\x80\x9csmothered\xe2\x80\x9d and burst out laughing. And laughing. And laughing. It was so embarrassing and I have to walk away. I finally compose myself and go back to the table. Almost lose it again but I make it through. \n\nThe couple was so chill that by the end of the meal I tell them the tube steak story. They went on to be my best regulars. '
b'That\xe2\x80\x99s fine if you bother to come by and ask if we need anything - which does not happen often enough.  I should not have to chase you down.   Or maybe  set the table properly / bring condiments in the first place.   '
b'One time my family and I were sat at an Applebee\xe2\x80\x99s. I waited five minutes after getting my food and asking the waitress the three times she checked on us for silverware before getting up and taking a set from the table next to us.  \n\nWe never even got refills on our drinks either that whole time. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t even busy. We could see the waitstaff chit chatting at the bar. Asked for refills and they never came. \n\nIf I could have gotten my own refills that time I would have. '
b"No offense, but if I need some ketchup for my fries and you did not bring a bottle with my order and there are full bottles on every other table and everytime I try to flag you down to ask for one? You glaze over and keep doing whatever you were doing?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm grabbing a bottle of ketchup from the next closest table whether you like it or not. I'm the one paying for the meal, I'm the one tipping you. If I need a ketchup and you seem too busy to be bothered? Im grabbing a ketchup. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nDon't want that happening? Pay attention to what's on the table OR HEAVEN FORBID ASK THEM IF THEY WOULD LIKE CONDIMENTS AS THEY ARE ORDERING, so they don't have to sit there for another 15 minutes waiting for you to look up or get close enough for them to ask. So they can eat their fries OR WHATEVER before they get cold. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI worked as both FOH and BOH management for years. I've been a busser, a hostess, a waitress and a bartender. I get the frustration, but either way you look at it? You're still gonna have bottles to fill and silverware to roll at the end of the shift no matter who you got sat with or what they did. It takes all of 2 minutes to clean up a closed table that's been raided by the table next to it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNo one's stealing, btw. They are using the amenities offered by said dining establishment that are available to all patrons, no matter what table. If you find this happens on your shifts constantly? The customers may not actually be the problem here.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAgain no offense and I'm not trying to troll or douche canoe. It's just the nature of the business and I know it sucks, but it could be easily avoided by taking the time to observe what's actually on the table as you take your customers orders. If you notice them ordering something that people generally use a specific condiment for? MAKE SURE THAT CONDIMENT IS AVAILABLE AS SOON AS THE DISH IS DELIVERED. They ask for coffee? Make sure the sugar packet container is full and that cream is available. They order Hot wings? Make sure there's ranch or blue cheese on the table and make a note if you need to bring more out. Same applies to napkins and silverware. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nPeople will stop grabbing shit off of other tables if you make sure they have what they need, BEFORE THEY HAVE TO ASK FOR IT. Figuring out what they may need is as easy as listening to their order. If they still need stuff and are not getting it and have to grab it off the next table? That's on you, not them. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou need to remember that what seems like 1 minute to you because you are so busy? Is actually like 15-30 minutes for the table you are waiting on. You think you've just checked on them, but in reality they've been sitting there for ages waiting for you to offer a refill on their sodas. You don't notice it because you are running around like a chicken with your head cut off. They on the other hand are just sitting there figuring out how to not tip you because they couldn't get some damn ketchup.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSorry for the tough love but it's true and I know you know it. Working in food service is brutal and if you're not on point at all times? You're going to have a rough time of it. Period.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGood luck and get out while you can. Customer service sucks and the food industry shows us people at their worst. Hungry people are scary and I'll leave this comment at that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks for reading and honest to god I'm not trying to be an ass or attack your personally. Just speaking my mind as someone who has spent their entire adult life on both sides of this kind of argument. I bet you are amazing at your job and I honestly do get it. But I've also experienced some pretty deplorable service recently so I guess I'm currently biased.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGoodluck to you and I hope people stop messing up your section as you try to close it down for the night. Truly!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;"
b"I hate this sooooo much, especially if they steal napkins or utensils from the adjacent table because they need extra napkins or they accidentally dropped their utensils on the floor and I couldn't get them a new one within 0.5 second. Excuse me but that was set up for the next party that's going to sit there and now I have to replace the ones you took. Also annoying when they've already ordered and I take their menu away, but they decide to take the menu off the adjacent table and then when the next party sits down at said adjacent table, they don't have any menu to look at because it's been taken!"
b"I sat in a restaurant once for almost half an hour. Couldn't find anyone (seriously, didn't get water or a greeting or anything, hostess sat us and then everyone apparently vanished.) It was my dad's birthday and his favorite place, which was the only reason we stuck it out for so long. \n\nAt about 29 minutes and 30 seconds, we decided we were going to leave at the 30 minute mark. We were gathering our coats when the server came over. Apparently they were having their staff pre-dinner-rush meeting and there was some kind of miscommunication, and since we were in a corner the one waiter who was covering the other tables didn't notice us.\n\nAt that point, I thought they'd maybe comp an app or something. After we ordered, the manager came over, apologized, and comped the entire meal! I still tipped 20% on what the bill would have been and didn't take it out on the staff, because shit happens. \n\nThat said, having sat forgotten in a restaurant for 30 minutes, I don't think there's any way anyone would do that for 90. Also, the restaurant that forgot us had a ticket on the table with the time printed on it, so I'd think that most places would be able to check. \n"
b'Or.. I mean... leave? If I\xe2\x80\x99m sitting somewhere for 15-20 min and cannot flag anyone down (and haven\xe2\x80\x99t been served beyond water and given a menu) I\xe2\x80\x99m just gonna walk. Done and done. Why would you sit there for an hour and a half??\n\nPeople suck.'
b'We had a waitress take out order, then straight up go home without giving it to anyone cause her shift was over... only found out after an hour passed and we started asking questions.. '
b'Well, better that than her actually coming in and stiffing her server. Good luck to whatever business served her on that day!'
b'Honestly, just focus on yourself and try to give the best service possible. Bomb and shit tippers will come and go! '
b'Dude. I had this one woman in a party of 4 order an unsweetened tea, to which I mentioned that we only had unsweetened tea. I brought it out to her, watched her put a packet of sugar in it, give it a stir, and take a sip. With the most disgusted look on her face, she pushed it to me and said, "I asked for UNSWEETENED tea."\n\nThe 3 other people at the table stared at her like she had sprouted a new head. They were all like, are you serious? She said they don\'t even have sweet tea!\n\nI\'m not entirely sure what was going on, if she was trying to start something or just got a concentrated shot of sugar up her straw or what, but that was a head scratcher for sure.'
b'But, did she complain about the next tea? '
b'I visited NY and stood at and air b&b in queens off of woodside. Was not expecting all the local bars to be Irish and I think Tibetan. Amazing time.  Also, one of the bars I went to was owned by a local bar owner where I live on the west coast (Irish) when he first moved to the states. Can\xe2\x80\x99t wait to visit again\n\n\nEdit: got a question about the bar, I can\xe2\x80\x99t remember the name of it. But most of the bars off woodside were close together, and I remember this one having a downstairs.  I loved staying in the cuts, I\xe2\x80\x99ll stay at the exact same place next time.  I think the kind ladies at the bodega were surprised to see someone way to happy to be buying things in their small store.  (Saw bodegas in movies, I was just stoked to be in one)'
b"I wish you were able to respond with that or look at them with surprise and ask how their lack of planning was your restaurant's fault."
b'I hate knowing I have unmedicated, untreated, and undiagnosed people working all around me in the FOH and BOH.   Honestly, I\xe2\x80\x99ve worked with quite a few people who I was sure would end up coming in and murdering all of us in a fit of mental fucketry. \nI\xe2\x80\x99m ok so far, there is this one dishwasher though...'
b'Flip everyone off on your last shift, pls\n\n&#x200B;'
b'I\xe2\x80\x99d want to write him a well crafted letter since you know who he is.  But it would probably be wasted on him.  \n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear Sir,\n\nMy partner and I noticed the other day when we were volunteering as servers to raise money for our orchestra trip that you did not seem to be happy with your experience.  We recommend for next year, if you require a special menu, that you make your request at the time of your ticket purchase. The funds from the ticket sales go to the caterers and I\xe2\x80\x99m certain they would be delighted to accommodate you given the opportunity. \n\nSincerely,\n\nOP\xe2\x80\x9d \n\n\xf0\x9f\x98\x89Help them out for next year. '
b'\xc2\xab\xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ll eat it anyway, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll hate it\xc2\xa0\xc2\xbb is pretty funny. You should have answered \xc2\xab\xc2\xa0Glad you like it, enjoy your meal\xc2\xa0\xc2\xbb.\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s impressive that you care so much but don\xe2\x80\x99t spend too much time thinking about it, the guy is a lost cause to be like that at his daughter\xe2\x80\x99s high school event.'
b'Honestly there needed to be an adult overseer with the balls to lay into any adult who is being a jerk.  My vote is for a sports coach who is best at policing rowdy parents.\n\nSeriously that guy needed to be asked to leave after the soup crap.\n\nReallt sorry you faced that. :(  It sounds like a great experience and really unique and you clearly worked hard.  You have a lot of integrity and pride in a job well done.  Dont let jerkwads like that get you down. \xe2\x99\xa1'
b"I used to get frustrated a lot, having bad nights that would leave me with barely any pocket cash to walk home with. It's even harder in certain states they take the tips from your paycheck, so you end up getting paid less than minimum wage sometimes. (Or at least, that's how it was for me in California three (?) years ago ) \nI would get angry as well, and it's easy to feel worn down quickly. \n\nMy advice?\n\nGive your all and do your best. Don't stop studying the menu and maybe even go to some local wine tasting spots and take notes so you can give advice and upsell drinks ! \nOn the holidays, a lot of people are pinched for cash. It shouldn't be like that, but it is. \nAnd all in all, if you aren't being treated right at your establishment, maybe it's time to widen your options. \n\nDon't forget there are people out there who know how to tip properly and will stack their plates to help you ! It's not completely hopeless, at least. \n"
b'Unfortunately, I\xe2\x80\x99d start looking for another part-time serving job, sounds like this dude wants to give you the old \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s just not working out...\xe2\x80\x9d routine very soon '
b'You\'re only available on weekends? Fuck this guy. There\'s plenty of places that need weekend help from a good server like you. (My place needs weekend help! Our new hire CRIED last week that she works weekends because, "I\'m only 22 and I NEED A LIIIIFE." Those are the only days she works.)'
b'Wait is not handing people cups a common practice? Because my asshole teenagers always make me sit on the inside of a booth and I\xe2\x80\x99ll often reach out to accept a drink from a server so they don\xe2\x80\x99t have to reach across to put it in front of me. I\xe2\x80\x99d hate to think I\xe2\x80\x99m getting someone in trouble.'
b'Because I was board one day I discovered that iced tea mixed with Mtn Dew looks an awful lot like a beer, head and all. I imagine most clear sodas would work as well.'
b'this seems like a toxic job for you to have. I\'ve been a server for about 6 months, a busser for 3 years. The only reasons anyone gets written up are for like... not doing their sidework or all of the things you have to do when you close, being late constantly, or disrespecting a boss or customer (something crazy like that). What you\'re getting written up for are mistakes. Clearly whoever is writing you up doesn\'t give a fuck about you or your current financial situations because they lack empathy. I suggest you apply to other jobs. play it safe. You should never have to fear for being fired just because you make mistakes every now and them. I once ran a mans credit card for the tab sitting across from him and my boss didn\'t care, came over to help rerun it and everything was fine. I\'ve spilled ice water on a woman on accident and everyone was like "That happens sometimes", i\'ve made mistakes and charged the restaurant money and they didn\'t even make me pay for it. Good bosses and owners understand that you can\'t have perfect employees because they\'re human. '
b"First, that's a horrible place to work. Second, making a few mistakes doesn't make you a bad server. Last, you dont need that stress dear. My advice is find a different restaurant. You're better than that. "
b'One time I was at an Italian chain restaurant with my kids.  An older man & woman was sitting across from us.  The woman was facing me.  Their soup/salad and breadsticks come.  Everything good, server is awesome. Their meals come, everything good, server is awesome.  I overhear the woman tell the man how delicious everything is and how isn\'t it nice to not have to pay for a good meal!  I thought they had a gift card for their meals.  \n\nA few minutes later, server comes over, woman wants the manager.  My interest has peaked!  Manger comes over, woman tells him the food is awful, server was nasty and they are not paying for "this garbage".  I was pissed!\n\n\nWhen manager was done with them - I stopped him and told him it was all bullshit, I told him what the woman said to her husband and that the server was in fact awesome.  The look on that woman\'s face was way worth me getting involved!  You better believe they paid for their meal & they were uninvited back!'
b"1) depends on the situation. For someone who is being a bitch, best to not engage. When the server comes over to your table let then know you overheard and that you're sorry they have to deal with those types of people. Don't ruin your meal just to help. That would make me feel even worse honestly. \n\n2) no, but a few customers have been perceptive enough to realize when shit is happening and small reassuring comments really do help a lot. "
b'two personal stories. when I was in my early twenties I was working at a busy restaurant  in a shopping area. It was an unseasonably warm day. I had a section on the patio and I got slammed with an eight top and like 5 other tables. I was running around trying to take care of everyone and I mixed up a few soft drinks for the eight top, so they all proceeded to start yelling at me. All eight people telling me how much I sucked. I was on the verge of tears when a woman at another one of my tables  yells at the eight top "leave her alone cant you see she\'s working her ass off!" it shut them all up. That nice lady and her husband got free beers. \nFast forward ten years. I was at an asian style chain restaurant with my girlfriend and the guy at the table next to me is yelling at the manager about his chicken being dry. the manager is offering to comp the meal and replace it,  with gift cards on top and this dude wasn\'t satisfied. so I leaned over and said "excuse me sir this man has offered to do everything in his power to make up for your dry chicken." he asked me what made me an expert , and I replied that I have been in the service industry for the last ten years. he threw his fortune cookies at me and left. My girlfriend and I got free dessert.\n'
b"I'm glad to hear this. I so hate reading about how big some egos get once someone experiences a bit of fame."
b'I have a friend who works at a pretty high end restaurant that recently served Post Malone. He and his 3 or 4 friends spent around $4000 (roughly half was on a $2k+ bottle of wine). He ended up tipping 100% and each of the three servers walked out of there with about a grand a piece after taxes.'
b'For a celeb cheapskate story in our work place we have a high end area and a separate just cafe grab and go. Mark whalburg(spelling?) accused the cashier of overcharging him just bc he was a celebrity and then called over the manager and the manager couldn\xe2\x80\x99t reason w him so he said sir your meal is comped. So he just got a free meal for basically throwing a tantrum . It was probably like an 8 dollar meal too. That made me sad bc I liked him'
b'I met Kevin James a long long time ago when the show was still being filmed. My pop warner football team was the right age for the kid actors hired so we got chosen to be the extras for the football episode. The whole time he was such a cool and down to earth guy. This was like over 15 years ago and still remember it fondly.'
b'My boss was telling me about an event he worked and Ice T and Coco were there. The event was a full service charity thing so it was all-inclusive. The tickets were paid for ahead of time so nobody had tabs. Coco wanted to tip the server but neither she nor Ice T had any cash. My boss said that Coco told Ice to give her his watch saying \xe2\x80\x9coh you\xe2\x80\x99ve got 50 at home\xe2\x80\x9d and gave the watch to the server. I used to think Coco was ridiculous but now I just love her.'
b'Agreed, I waited on Kevin James and his wife in Chicago a couple times back in the day and they were awesome people. Funny story, the first time I waited on them his wife was there first waiting for him. She mentioned her husband was an actor and would be in later and he would be taking care of the check. Just so happened Joe Mantegna was sitting at the table next to her so I assumed this was her husband having some sort of business meeting. I gave Mantegna her check too when they asked for the tab and he was all \xe2\x80\x9cuhhhhh... no?\xe2\x80\x9d. It was a good laugh for everyone when we all figured out what was going on.'
b'Some celebs are great folks. Cuba Gooding Jr came into my bar during the NFL playoffs in 1998 with 3 friends. When he sat down I asked him if he wanted a tab or if he was gonna "SHOW ME THE MOOONEEEEYY!" (Jerry Macguire quote). He laughed hard and said "You\'re good Brentwood_Bro!" All the guests LOVED him. He was gracious to the entire bar. Ran up a massive tab and tipped out me AND the cocktail girl 100% of the tab. He also took the cocktail waitress out that night. Great experience.'
b"I was so afraid that's was going. be a story of him being an asshole and a shitty Tipper. Very relieved to find the opposite! I have always had very neutral feelings about him, neither especially like nor dislike. But he just gained many points in my opinion!"
b"Thank you, was reading with dread that it wasn't going to end well. I always hate to hear the cheapskate celebrity stories."
b'He seems like a down to earth dude.'
b'My dad worked on a Kevin James film and at the end bought everyone who worked on it an iPod (they were fairly new at the time) with the movie name engraved on it. '
b"I've always heard that he's a great, down to earth guy. "
b'Hmmm. I\xe2\x80\x99m 44. I was a server in my college days, and after graduation worked production on commercials and movies. I left production to work for Funimation as an ADR engineer and also cut the trailers for the future DVD releases until leaving for a marketing position for an American made apparel and accessory manufacturer where I still work with contacts in the industry for product placement.  \n\nI guarantee you that you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen my companies products on high profile actors. \n\nSadly never Kevin James. '
b'A 60% tip is showing respect for your job?  Huh? Actors by their very nature crave attention and approval. Kevin James just successfully bought that attention and approval from you.  In fact it was a great investment on his part. Here you are singing his praises. '
b'Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m not allergic to people, I just hate them when they act like you. '
b'Gender reveal parties are so obnoxious anyway. '
b'Could have been worse. He could have let you work your ass off and then only tipped 10%. So good thing he gave you the heads up so you could give him the service he deserved. '
b'You did that exactly right. I would love to know if I was going to get a shitty tip so I can base my service how well they pay me. It sucks to bust your ass for hours and wind up getting severely underpaid. Sucks butt. '
b'Ugh I totally know how you feel. We have these two creepy guys who always come in literally one or two minutes before close. They are a father and son who wear MATCHING OUTFITS. The father is in his 70s and the son in his 50s. The dad is always hitting on every waitress that walks by and one day he did the unthinkable.. on the way to the bathroom he stopped by a table where there was a mother who was breastfeeding. He reached down and started RUBBING THE BABY\xe2\x80\x99S HEAD... while the baby is breastfeeding. Definitely top 5 craziest shit I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen while waitressing.'
b"where I work we have a strict last call policy where after last call is made (usually 5-10 minutes before close), customers are not allowed to order anymore because the kitchen is closed. That means if your incomplete party come in 15-20 minutes before close and the rest of your party aren't there before last call is made, either you get someone in the party to order your food for you, or you're SOL. "
b'Oof.\n\nOkay EVERYONE is the asshole here.\n\nThe kitchen is an asshole for fucking up the orders.\n\nThat table is full of assholes for showing up literally last minute and expecting anything.\n\nCorporate is an asshole for putting you in that position.\n\nYou were an asshole, yes, you were visibly pissed and I dont think you actually gave the level of service you wouldve in a good mood.\n\nSeriously though everyone is allowed a bad day.\n\nAmerica is an asshole for allowing the tipping culture we do.\n\n\n\n'
b'I keep seeing people posting about "rude" customers walking in a bit before closing time.  You know, this may not be popular here, but closing time does not mean people should stop coming in 30 minutes before.  It just means that is the last people will be let in the door.  The restaurant is STILL open until that party(s) is gone.  The bar should have never been closed while you were actively still serving a table.  You should always remain open while those people are there.  I\'m not saying they were in the right to be rude to you but you said you were "visibly mad" at them.  They ordered something "45 minutes after the restaurant was closed." You do not get it - the restaurant is not closed until they walk out that door. Those people deserve the same kind of service you gave the first customers of the night.  '
b'One of the most infuriating experiences I\xe2\x80\x99ve had was a woman that came in for a carry out order and then saw one of our servers brush some hair out his face and she exploded about how that was unsanitary and that she had a child with cancer at home with a weakened immune system and that could lead to serious complications. I looked at her and said so you\xe2\x80\x99re telling me that instead of providing for your child at home within an absolute controlled environment, which you should absolutely be doing in this instance, you decide to order carry out at a chain which obviously will not have as strict sanitation. Shit happens lady but you can\xe2\x80\x99t expect anyone besides yourself to do it completely right. Well she didn\xe2\x80\x99t like that one bit...'
b"Oh I had one of them back in my fast food days. Crazy woman had a hissy fit when I told her in no uncertain terms, changing diapers on tables wasn't going to happen. She kicked up such a fuss the shift manager came out and yelled at the manager who was even less nice than me. I heard a rumor later, she'd called corporate and they hung up on her.\nPeople seriously need to stop breeding these brain addled creatures"
b"One time, when my son was like 3, he had been dealing with a serious chronic illness since he was a baby and my husband and I had just driven across 4 states to take him to a specialist children's hospital. We got to our hotel finally and thankfully, they had a restaurant attached. We walked in and placed our drink order (my poor husband just wanted his beer after the long drive) when our son looked like he was gonna throw up. My husband grabbed him and tried to run out, but he threw up all over by the lobby area. I was super embarrassed and asked for cleaning supplies, but they wouldn't let me clean it up. They said they werent allowed to let me clean it. They said they could bring our food to our room and I cancelled the beer and thanked them profusely. The guy who brought our food up also brought a beer up for my husband. They werent supposed to, but I had told the girl about our situation and she felt bad for us I guess. He got a huge tip. We ate there every night we were there and left great tips and apologized like a million times and got a manager to thank for how great the service was as well as leaving a glowing review online. I cannot imagine not trying to clean it up though and just leaving. I felt horrible leaving it for someone else to clean up as it was!"
b"Lots of bars in St Louis are picking it up as a cheap option on draft. I worked at a high end cocktail bar and we had it on draft for people that didn't want to spend ten dollars per drink and we sold the shit out of it, and it was a staff favorite as well."
b"Why do people do this? In my experience it's usually been older men and they won't drop it even if I'm obviously uncomfortable. Like I don't know if I'm greek or italian so do you need a refill??"
b'So what type of European ancestry do you have, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t mind me asking? For example, do you have any Spanish, Italian, Norwegian, or German blood? Maybe Czech? Or British? Americans tend to lump all Europeans as \xe2\x80\x9cwhite\xe2\x80\x9d if their family have been here for a few generations, which I think is a shame, considering what a diverse group Europeans are! '
b'Shit happens to me all the time. Don\xe2\x80\x99t have an answer because assholes will be assholes. I\xe2\x80\x99m super duper Canadian with no discernible culture- one grandma is genetically Italian but Irish by birth, one grandpa was half French and half First Nations but refused to acknowledge either, and my other side of the family has been here since before we can track (without much effort on or part tbh) and generally some genetic mix of Scandinavian, Germanic and Celtic. So I have pale, pale skin that tans really dark and easily in summer, high/defined cheekbones, very dark hair and eyes and a mishmash of facial features. I also work in a Mexican restaurant. I think that people have probably guessed that I am literally every race under the sun, but I\xe2\x80\x99ve had the odd person who gets actually OFFENDED when I say I don\xe2\x80\x99t know and don\xe2\x80\x99t care. It usually seems to be rooted in a combination of ego and racism- like if they find me attractive I must be partly descended from their race and there\xe2\x80\x99s no way that I could be that way if I were also descended from races they deem inferior. If it gets to that point I usually just force out a laugh and say something like \xe2\x80\x98as far as I know my parents are telling me the truth- I think I\xe2\x80\x99m just Canadian!\xe2\x80\x9d and walk away.\n\nSucks though. Sorry it happened to you. When it\xe2\x80\x99s not happening in a work context I 100% call it out because it\xe2\x80\x99s definitely borne out of racism. Not much you can do at work unless it\xe2\x80\x99s outright though. '
b'I had an older gentleman INSIST I was part Asian (I\xe2\x80\x99m not!) and WOULD NOT let it go. He was at a business lunch and it was awkward as hell. He kept telling me I was wrong, with my eye shape etc. I just had to have Asian heritage...so rude and weird! '
b'When I pack to go orders I pack double or "extra" sides in two separate containers.  If people only see one container they assume they only got one portion.  Sometimes people are just so goddamn petty.'
b"I'm not a server. But I'm a guy with a skinny ass. Due to cancer.\n\nPeople will make random comments about that.\n\nMy response is not pleasant.\n\nFolks should really mind their own business."
b'Years ago, when I was 22-23, I worked at a popular diner third shift, near a big university. I\xe2\x80\x99ve always had a big booty, so drunk guys would hit on me from time to time, but since I was married the ring, or me saying something, was enough to shut it down. \n\nOne guy though just couldn\xe2\x80\x99t take a hint, and would come in almost every night. He was funny and friendly, so the other servers liked him, but he zeroed in on me as his crush. Would refer to me as Ms. Fat Bottoms. Not the most flattering thing to hear yelled across a busy restaurant. One night. I corrected him, as I did, that I\xe2\x80\x99m married, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t appreciate him calling me that...so he changed it to *Mrs* Fat Bottoms. Did not make me feel much better. Unfortunately my manager was not very supportive of us, and felt it was a funny compliment, so I just dealt with it.'
b"Last job I worked I was the only male FOH employee and we had disproportionately way more male guests than female, so I heard a lot of stuff like this. The one that really threw me off was from an older couple who came in 2 or 3 times a week. Every employee would easily put them in their top 10 of our regulars. Just such a nice older couple who loved to chat and were never a pain. \n\n So one day I get their table and the wife starts asking me during our conversation about one of my coworkers. Out of nowhere she's not so gently trying to ask if she happens to be pregnant. I felt horrible for my coworker, she had been putting weight on over the past couple months, but thats what happens when you eat chicken strips every shift. I couldn't bring myself to say a word of it to any of my coworkers and just kinda laughed and played it off with the couple. Stuck me as weird as I would have expected it from one of the younger bros that frequented the place, not from her. "
b'WOW this is so crazy, a few months ago I had something really similar happen to me. A group of douchey twenty-something year olds guys came in, I served them, and as they were leaving they gave the hostess a note with one of their numbers on it and said \xe2\x80\x9cgive this to the blonde with the fat ass.\xe2\x80\x9d Like.... why the fuck would I call you.....'
b'The only people I know who order long islands are 21 year olds, and trash. '
b"Am I a bad person to think that what they said wasn't that bad? Imo 1. It was basically a compliment\n2. They never said anything like that to your face\n\nIdk. Pls don't hate on me for this I'm just saying how I feel about it. I'm probably wrong but I'd like to see what you guys think"
b'I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry! I really wish I could host a mandatory management seminar like a boot camp for management. One of the big things I would cover is employees calling in sick. Anything potentially contagious even a common cold could be life threatening for someone with a compromised immune system so any illness the employee needs to take a day off. Not all illness should have to require a doctors note either unless the restaurant foots the bill or offers full health benefits which will never happen.  '
b"If I were you, any time I have off I'd be out looking for something better. Don't just quit because of your cash situation but it sounds like anything would be better than your current situation. "
b'Do you at least get back in your check the tips you\xe2\x80\x99re forced to give to the boss? Maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s good from the perspective of tax reporting but I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s common practice at all. \n\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve worked for bad owners before and there\xe2\x80\x99s no reason to stick around, it will never get any better. Like the one above me said, spend your free time looking for a better serving gig. '
b'What a rude guy, I have regulars who are always complaining about food coming late when they order like 7 well done t bone steaks, almost always end up comping one or two of the steaks but the managers are too soft to put their foot down with them. Btw why is your restaurant allowing children to walk around barefoot? We have strict policies on that to avoid any injuries to tiny feet :/'
b'Word of advice: always pad rhe estimated time by about 5 minutes.  That way when things go right, you get it out "super fast" and theyre grateful, and when things go wrong the customer has no idea. :)\n\n'
b"That quote at the end... I've been doing this for a long time, and that sums it up quite nicely. Good post. Glad you had a magic gem on the hallmark holiday."
b'This reminds me of a table I had a while ago. Judged them immediately to be white trash,  they were super demanding, and basically I expected nothing from them. Dropped off their approx $50 bill and they said they needed a minute, so I left. When I came back there was $20 on the table and they were gone. I was fuming. Then the bartender came over and handed me a slip. They had gone up to the bar and paid for the bill on their card and the 20 was my tip. Whoops'
b"I worked as a server for a number of years, in various different establishments.\n\nOne thing that always held true was that Valentine's Day was the absolute worst day of the year for tipping.\n\nMy theory is this. \n\nValentine's day is the one day of the year that people want to make a *particularly special effort* for their date or significant other.\n\nSo, they go to a restaurant which is out of their ordinary price range. One step up from their usual haunt.\n\nYour regulars, who come to you year-round and tip well, all go to an even fancier restaurant for their valentine's meal.\n\nSo, on valentine's day, your restaurant fills with people who you never usually see. People who can't afford to come to you the other 364 days of the year. \n\nAs your restaurant is way more expensive than they're used to, they're less likely to tip, as the bill will already be super high (relative to what they're used to).\n\nThis is true no matter what kind of restaurant you work in. Even if you work in a cheap-and-cheerful chain restaurant, the people that come to you on V Day are the type who would usually eat at Subway or order off the McDonald's dollar menu. \n\nEverywhere I worked, every year, my Valentine's Day tables were filled with people I didn't recognise. Usually awkward-looking young people. They all stiffed me."
b"Amount of food to cost, y'all are practically fast food prices! If they can't tip on a $8-9 meal, then they should have gone McDonalds. So shitty of them.\n\nWhen I was living in Maryland, (in between Baltimore and DC) one of these restaurants opened up right before I was moving away. Went to lunch one day with a bunch of co-workers. One just could not stop practically gushing over the amount of food he got for the price."
b'Sorry you went through that.  I prefolded a dollar bill into a heart for a tip before we even went out last night.  Here\xe2\x80\x99s a virtual one instead \xf0\x9f\x92\x9a. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you deserve it and many more.'
b'I worked last night as well. I had 2 tables short me and one table got into a physical altercation and were asked to leave.\n\nNo one made money despite there being a ridiculous amount of reservations.\n\nHolidays are so overrated! Not worth it. '
b'I work at the barrel of saltines too and my shift went the same way yesterday'
b'This is the reality of every major "go out for dinner" holiday. People who go out like 2x a year are hitting that place that\'s normally too expensive to ever consider and tipping becomes a chore.\n\nKeep your head down, and expectations low and you survive it. \n\nMy V-day in summary - sold roughly what I would sell on a busy Saturday, was stuck at work and hour and a half longer than that same weekend shift, almost had to take ressies at 10 (when we close normally on a Thursday) and served the nicest table I have had in a while alongside the single worst guest I have had the displeasure of interacting with in probably a year. '
b"After 20+ years in the restaurant business, I've come to dread holidays. It's really amateur night for customers.\n\nLet me preface my comments with this : I am more than happy to go above and beyond for guests which other servers/bartenders see as cheap. Maybe it's a special occasion. Maybe they've been scraping by for a long time and this is a treat. Maybe they've had some personal problem that has drained their bank account and they're still recovering. Whatever the reason, I endeavor to have them enjoy their meal at my restaurant. I rarely encounter truly rude guests, and I genuinely enjoy making someone's day a little better by giving them a great dining experience.\n\nHolidays are the rub. Holidays bring the entitled, rude, jackwagons out. Suddenly our drinks are too weak. Food that has steam rising from it is cold. That steak which is now missing 3/4ths of the weight you delivered it at is magically tough and cooked wrong. Jesus H.\n\nI will move mountains for guests when something goes wrong. I really hate having a guest leave disappointed. The gratuity, while very important for obvious reasons, takes a back seat in my mind if someone is unhappy. You never know if you've lost a revenue stream by providing less than great service and subpar food. And, call me a liar, but the happiness of my guests matters to me personally....unless that guest is a raging dickwad. In that case, they can eat a bowl of rancid assholes. \n\nHolidays bring dickwads out in droves. It's exhausting both mentally and physically. Experienced servers who can handle their station and more with ease get thrown into the weeds by customers who want to complain about everything until they're comped. Brand new servers literally burst into tears because they've never been treated like they do in a holiday. \n\nIt sucks. But I take comfort in knowing there're only a few holidays to deal with, and things return to normal very quickly after one of them. If you work today, I hope it makes up for yesterday. \n"
b'I deal with the same problem on a daily basis. I work at a family owned restaurant and many people do not tip for some reason. The food is reasonably priced and we give great service. I am just wondering, what are the reasons given by individuals who chose not to tip? Please do not say "if you don\'t like it get a better job", as I am working as a server to pay for my college education and nursing school.'
b'Idk how you deal with working there. I have only been once but apparently no other tables tipped the one time I did go. '
b'Servers at Cracker Barrel get shafted a lot. Keep your head up. Sincerely, your friendly neighborhood grill cook. '
b'cracker barrellll haha that place attracts some real white trash'
b'I work here as well and that\xe2\x80\x99s annoying. I served 11-4 yesterday and it was busy as hell. So glad I got someone to cover my evening shift. I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry they didn\xe2\x80\x99t tip you. Our food is NOT expensive wtf. Also if I eat there I usually tip the bill bc it\xe2\x80\x99s so inexpensive and I love my coworkers. Hope you have a better day where you get alll the tips! \xf0\x9f\x92\x93'
b"Follow your absolutes. Ask your shift leader and par 4s for help. Dont let yourself fall behind so you can keep an eye on everyone.  Also if you had a new cashier, ask to see if they're entering in credit tips properly.  I've missed out on tips back in my serving days due to bad cashiers. (Sad, but true) remember one bad day doesn't ruin your whole week.  Please people and they will please you."
b'Damn 5 top for only 60 bucks is really cheap. That\xe2\x80\x99s really annoying. I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. I worked a double yesterday and it was hell. Understaffed with a full house. Made good money but I was dead at the end of the night.'
b'I worked for the country chain myself as a server for valentines last year and it was so bad I made it my last day. It was almost my last day anyways as I\xe2\x80\x99d gotten a new job and already put in my two weeks, but I could not go back. I dreaded even thinking about dealing with people like that again. My tips there were really bad too. Maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s just bad luck for me. Idk. \xf0\x9f\xa4\xb7\xe2\x80\x8d\xe2\x99\x80\xef\xb8\x8f'
b'Work fine dining. Roommate is casual fine dining. \n\nTold her I think I have ptsd from last night and the only cure is whiskey. Unfortunately I work the next 6 days.... unfortunately.\n\nDeath by two top.'
b'I serve occasionally still, used to be fine dining (average tip out would be 500-600 weekend night) - serve at a super chill restaurant now, not remotely fine dining - but definitely not a chain (Independently owned restaurants tips usually much better). Anyway, We aren\xe2\x80\x99t fine dining at all. Average bill is still 100$ for 2 people, especially on Valentine\xe2\x80\x99s Day which was 138$ for two people, for all tables. Special menu. I walked with 450$ \xe2\x80\x94- reading your post infuriates me. Sounds like you are working in a shitty area though cause 60$ is obscenely cheap/low for restaurants. Find a rich destination town or just richer area and get a restaurant job there. Depending where you are, even a busser might make more than you are serving. It\xe2\x80\x99s disgusting that people didn\xe2\x80\x99t tip you there, infuriating. Sorry that happened dude. For real though dude, it\xe2\x80\x99s worth it to work ground level up in a restaurant that actually makes money. '
b"Might not be for you, but a hope to not lose heart.. some of us care about you as a person.. especially my almost 7yr old.. (next month.. she's 7 fuck it)\n\nI gifted my child $15 for Valentine's, partly for en early bday gift as money is tight, also took us to an Italian mum and pop kinda restaurant, it's always got cheep food, they get my kids autism and no saucy or runny type foods can be had. Just wanted a cute mummy daughter thing. \n\nShe went to the toilet, normal. Came back with a rose for me from the basket they had at the register for Valentine's Day. Cute right? For sure. She went to the toilets again... Long enough I was worried. \n\nThe roses were $1ea. There was 8 working all up (again mum and pop total hole in the wall place for better idea), she worked out at the table with her $15, she could by $9 in roses, gift 8 to all the staff on shift and also me a rose and still have enough to buy their shared thing if a $9 pavlova slice for two (her and I). \n\nThat pav slice wasn't paid for. As the staff were chuffed a 7yr old decided to buy them all roses, because as she said to the one who brought it to my attention 'mummy says todays a day to make people feel appreciated'. \n\nBut if it comes to it with pavlova, I doubt anyone would of got a rose. Pavlova is a serious thing in this house. "
b'A tip is TECHNICALLY optional. As in it is not required by law. You won\xe2\x80\x99t get arrested for not paying that. However the staff knows if you don\xe2\x80\x99t tip and we for darn sure remember your face and we think you\xe2\x80\x99re a jerk. If you don\xe2\x80\x99t care about that then good for you. We don\xe2\x80\x99t like you and that\xe2\x80\x99s not a crime just like not tipping. A tip is optional. By law. We can\xe2\x80\x99t make you pay a tip (unless you have a party of 6+ then the service charge gets charged automatically and it\xe2\x80\x99s part of the bill. ) but tips are technically optional. Most people are not like this. It\xe2\x80\x99s rare but unfortunately not uncommon.  '
b'I hate the holidays that people go up in price for like Vday , fathers day, mothers day, etc. while working at a casual dining place.\n\nPeople who normally go to fast food go to these restaurants and are cheap, rude, insane, and generally act like they have never been in a restaurant before.  \n\nI am sorry that happened to you!'
b'This might be hugely unpopular but: Americans really need to stop calling customers \xe2\x80\x98cheap\xe2\x80\x99. Your businesses are cheap. Your system is stupid. \n\nI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry you didn\xe2\x80\x99t get any tips from them but it really should be down the business to pay their staff appropriately rather than have customers literally hand them their wages. '
b'I work at a local diner chain, the store i serve at is in the hood. We get so many ppl in there who are extremely ignorant and are fine with their server serving them for free or for $4 on a $60 check. I just mentally write them off as trashy but it does get to you so i feel you. Keep fighting the good fight \\m/'
b"I work at the same place and lemme fucking tell you- if they think *that's* expensive, they definitely can't afford to go out to eat."
b'This is exactly why I had to quit that chain. So many of my customers just wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t tip, or would tip $1/person. I work at a much smaller, quieter restaurant now, and despite having less customers and less hours I make double what I made before.\n\nAlso I\xe2\x80\x99ve never been double/triple sat as badly as when I worked there. It drove me insane!!'
b'These days are the worst. So much running around  bullshit with the bar, kitchen fuck ups, mistakes on you end. And at the end of the day you get shit. Im not gonna lie, yesterday i made alright money, but any given saturday, when everything is calm and uneventful, i cash in 1.5-2 times more.'
b'It will get better and you will continue to get better at the job itself.  There will always be bad shifts, it happens, but money is money, and the one thing that has always worked for me is...KILL them with kindness.  And stay positive, it will get better.  I hope you always lay down for the night with a smile'
b'i work at the same chain you do and the same thing happens to me. i don\xe2\x80\x99t know if it\xe2\x80\x99s just that the people that go there are trash or if they truly believe that we get paid enough to warrant not tipping.  i\xe2\x80\x99m sorry that happened though :/'
b"I just have no respect for people like this. I've never worked in the service industry but I have been on this sub for a while because I like to hear about what it's like on the other end of the industry. My girl and I went to a nicer than our usual restaurants and we had a fantastic experience.\n\nIn my opinion, if you're going to go out of budget like we did, you need to consider that 20% tip at the end. We ended up spending less than I expected (still $80 per person including alcohol) but I still tipped well over 20%. Our waiter was fantastic and I could tell they were working so hard. I can't imagine not knowing how much money you come home with every day after a long shift. Kudos to all of you who work Valentine's day and every other shitty money-based holiday! "
b'Ok, what the fuck. It\xe2\x80\x99s your employer\xe2\x80\x99s job to give you those livable wages. Tips only help the people on top, because they can just pay you less. '
b'I remember going out to eat with my wife and her grandparents, having to fix the tip they left behind...literally coins on the table. As I got older and wiser, I just made sure to pick up the check myself.'
b"This is some bullshit. If you PM your PayPal email, I will send you a 20% tip, assuming that each bill was $60. I'm not even kidding.\n\nFor the record, I'm a 43 year old woman who is sick of people's shit today - not a creeper. Just someone who wants to cancel out some of the bullshit.\n\n\n\n"
b'People who are complaining about the nature of tipping need to stop. You. Are. The. Problem.\n\nI would love for the U.S. to get to the point where servers make what they are worth from the restaurant in wages without relying on tips. BUT not tipping because you want to *protest the system* (cop out for being cheap) only causes a hard working citizen from being short on rent, or car payment, or child care etc. \n\nThe only way for the change to happen industry wide is for minimum wage laws to change when it comes to servers. We are very far away from that, and I wish I had a good way to suggest doing this except for bringing the issue up to local politicans and such.\n\nThe reality is people with empathy and compassion will over tip. And while I will continue to be that person, the reality is this allows for the cheap skates to justify not tipping in the facade of "sticking it to the man"'
b"Urg. If you can't afford to tip, don't go out to eat"
b'Unpopular opinion but I dont think its shitty on them to not tip. I understand that we make our money through tips but if they felt the food was a bit too expensive for their family to tip out then I personally think that\xe2\x80\x99s fair. Sometimes people want to take their family to somewhere other than McDonalds but at the end of the night can only afford the tab. My family was in this position a fee times when I was a kid so maybe thats why im more understanding, i grew up really poor but sometimes when my parents got bonuses they\xe2\x80\x99d take us somewhere nicer than a fast food place but couldn\xe2\x80\x99t tip out more than a few dollars if anything at all. I understand this is terrible for you and im truly sorry but at the end of the day people just want to make nice memories with family and unfortunately that sometimes comes at our expense. '
b'I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry they stiffed you :/\n\nA perspective I\xe2\x80\x99ve recently started adopting is that sometimes people just don\xe2\x80\x99t know about tipping culture and this is the only time they\xe2\x80\x99ve been able to afford to take their little family out to eat all year. Even if they didn\xe2\x80\x99t tip, they will remember the great service and maybe cause it to bring in friends that will. Idk. I try to look at things in a way where I don\xe2\x80\x99t feel like utter garbage at the end of the night. Don\xe2\x80\x99t count your tips as they hit the table. Count them at the end of the night. Are you satisfied with that amount? '
b'Eww. I consider a good tip part of the "budget" of eating out. I mean, I understand that tipping culture sucks, but people aren\'t "sticking it to the man" by not tipping - they\'re sticking it to their server, whose actual paycheck isn\'t much more than the bill they just paid. '
b"This tips system causes so much trouble. Why even have it?\n\nEDIT: Now I know why and wow you guys have it hard. I wish you all the luck you can get cause you don't get paid nearly enough to put up with a lot of the shit they give you"
b'WUT. \nHow do people do this??? \nI am so sorry. That\xe2\x80\x99s so foolish. How in the world do people go out to eat and not tip and live on with a clear conscious.\nIf you can\xe2\x80\x99t afford to tip you can\xe2\x80\x99t afford to be served at a restaurant. \n\nStay home muthaaaafuggaaa.'
b"the worst part about corporate restaurants is you can't question the customer on a tip. pretty infuriating but I think yesterday was just full of assholes. Head up OP it will always come back around to you :) if this is a common occurance at your place it's probably time to work elsewhere "
b"So 3 separate families stiffed you at the same time? I've maybe been stiffed 3-4 times in all my years of a server..but 3 at once? Or they just all tipped you like shit? "
b"Unfortunately, Valentine's is often the only night some of these people go out. They are not regular diners. Often, the men feel forced to go out already and are not happy to be spending money and put little effort into it. The women have high expectations that are rarely met. The kids should be with babysitters, but get trailed along on the date. \n\nAm I stereotyping? Probably. But I've never worked a Valentine's where at least one table was in tears. And a server or two. Especially at crappy chain restaurants.\n\nYou survived. Wear the badge with Honor. And get ready for mother's day. Then you'll be good until New Years. "
b'So sad. It sounds like the average check per person was $12 including drinks.  I\xe2\x80\x99m so sorry that happened to you.'
b'My friends and I went out to eat last night. One of my bros tried to leave a 25 cent tip on a $20 tab. \n\nPeople are so obnoxious sometimes'
b'I am from a country that does not tip & hate the practice as it is not second nature to me. Example, you have a couple drinks at the bar and then eat at the restaurant that is attached to the same place, do you pay and tip twice or pay once & tip twice, if only tipping once then what happens to the dude at the bar who served me a drink.  \n\n\nAnother one, you are on a red bus in NYC that does tours, paid your big$$ for the tour which is hop on and hop off, am I supposed to tip at the end of the entire bus trip or every time I get off???  \n\n\nAnyway I mention those things because I would never not tip in a place where tipping is customary regardless of the price and regardless of the occasion. I would have though people who did not tip in the US who are from the US would risk being shot for doing that.\n\nI understand I get a bit of leeway but would have thought people like that can look forward to not being served in a timely fashion.'
b'I waited tables all through schools and I HATED valentine\xe2\x80\x99s day! Most people who don\xe2\x80\x99t normally go out to eat (probably can\xe2\x80\x99t afford) to want to treat their significant others to a nice meal on Valentine\xe2\x80\x99s Day. It was one of the worst days of the years. And it\xe2\x80\x99s always packed!!'
b"Idk people are strange. I dont work the food industry but I work in an area with a lot of upper middle class people and they dont tip the pizza drivers and sometimes the orders are huge. \n\n I found this out after a coworker ordered a pizza and then apologized for what he felt was a inadequate tip. The driver was pretty happy and proceeded to tell my coworker how they never get tips in this area and that it was appreciated. The store wasnt far from all the neighborhoods in the area either (like 5 minutes in all directions) so it's not like they couldnt just go pick it up to avoid the delivery fee that the driver dosent get.\n\nSo like I said people are strange and have bad excuses for not tipping. \n\nEdit: a sentence"
b"Rah it's tough in the US,  in the UK most places tipping is non existent and plus some places charge a service charge at the end of the meal\n"
b'I just wanna say I worked as a "waiter" (it was at a buffet so not really) and I made 3.50/hr without tips. Please tip guys. (I am aware they have to give me the minimum wage if that +tips does not equal it. It was 7.25 at the time)'
b"Shouldn't the owners give a 15 percent tip on all your sales of food? If a table doesn't tip, you get that 15 percent. \n\nIt only makes sense. I'd be more mad at the owners than the buyers. "
b'Nobody owes you a tip. Get that through your head. '
b"I worked in food service for years as a cook. I always see servers complaining about someone not tipping, y'all still make quite a bit more than BoH employees. They could have walked out in the bill. You aren't entitled to tips. To clarify I always tip well because I worked in food service for years. That doesn't mean your entitled to their generosity. Maybe they didn't give a fuck about prompt service. That sucks you got stiffed but such is life. Find a job that doesn't force you to live off of tips and you won't have to deal with those types of people anymore. Fucking food service is the worst. Shitty environment, shitty customers and after so long that shit just drags you down."
b"Yeah that sucks, but it's a bit much telling people if they don't tip don't go out to eat. If you can't afford to live the lifestyle you want with your current job, get a new job. Tipping is a gratuitous, not mandatory."
b'my restaurant also doesn\'t seat incomplete parties and we have signs stating so. Even when you put yourself on the waitlist through Yelp you get a text notification saying "you are now on the waitlist blah blah blah, in order to be seated please make sure all members of your party are present, check in with the host when you arrive". '
b"Maybe a tad overzealous. Life happens people are late, people cancel, people decide to come last minute. I mean I wouldn't want to spend my money to a place that didn't feel accommodating as far as seating goes. I'm not one to get upset about the small stuff because I work in the industry but that's a bit much. "
b'That man is the best! It can turn a whole shift around! '
b"Some days, such as valentines day, I know going into work I'm just going to get some asshole in my section. I can just start to *feel* it. Theres just some kind of disturbance in the force.\n\nHalf the time recently I just go in, not even hoping to make a small fortune in tips, but just to get through the day without some asshole making me bend over backwards. I would easily take a stress free day with no extra effort over a stressful but good day in tips"
b"I love this! I had the same thing happen somewhat last night, I had the bar tables and the bar itself was pretty crowded mostly with yuppie Ivy league bros who do.not.move. when I say excuse me. Best part, they stand in a freaking  circle with all this space. I had this awesome table, a couple, who were just fun and the guy was telling jokes and they were very easy to serve. The kind of table that makes me love my job. Now I have 6 tables at this point so I'm trying to multitask and bring drinks to multiple tables on my tray and I can't get through the bros. At one point this dude stuck his elbow out and hit me but I somehow managed to not spill everything. Anyways, the nice guy was like hey you are doing an awesome job navigating through this crowd and people are being dicks. Just like having someone say hey I see how hard you work and your doing great. He left me a $30 tip on $48 which was amazeballs but ya it was the acknowledgement that really got me through."
b"Embrace it. You go to a restaurant to eat food. Eat it and enjoy it. Personally, I like trying to figure out how the restaurant works. It's a fun little game I play."
b'After 20 years in the industry (out for 5) I\xe2\x80\x99m always hyper aware of what\xe2\x80\x99s going on in the restaurant around me. It\xe2\x80\x99s hardwired into my brain to notice things.  \n\nI notice servers walking off not pre bussing tables, I notice servers rolling their eyes seeing the table they were sat, notice the servers that are hustling constantly with full hands. I see the good managers that help out and the crappy managers that just point and complain about things.   I see the customer giving the server a hard time just because they can. \nI give my husband the play by play he\xe2\x80\x99s always like \xe2\x80\x9chow do you see all this\xe2\x80\x9d \n\nEvery time we eat out I\xe2\x80\x99m reminded why I got out of the business. '
b'I get it too. However I live in Australia so I constantly notice when waitresses are purposefully not looking at tables because they want to avoid them, an unfortunate byproduct of not relying on tips for wages. If the girls/guys want to put minimum effort in that day then they can without worrying about their paycheck at the end of it. '
b'it gets better with time, but it might take a while'
b"Yup, it's tough.  I have the added thoughts of, I can make this food better (BOH here).\n\nTakeout, delivery, and cheap hole in the wall joints are much easier for me.  I know what to expect.\n\nI need to be in the mindset that I'm about to be treated to wonderful service and tasty food.  Booze always helps drown out the background noise, as well as good company.  When I do find that I have not noticed the nonsense, I realize I had a great dining out experience, and by then I'm probably drunk."
b"Before reading this sub I didn't realize how nightmarish Valentine's Day is for servers (although I should have)... I had a super awesome experience last night and now I'm inspired to email the restaurant and make a big deal about what a great job they did. "
b'I know a lady who whenever her and her husband go into a new restaurant they do the birthday thing just to get free dessert. Totally trashy and I\xe2\x80\x99ve called her on it many times but she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t care'
b'Ugh, hope they don\xe2\x80\x99t end up stalking her at the gym.'
b"I don't get people looking down on servers? I'm a mom. At my house I am chef, server, bus girl and dishwasher. If I go to a sit down restaurant, THANK YOU SO MUCH!!! I get to sit on my ass while you bring me drinks and hot food I ORDERED and I get to eat it hot to boot. If someone else at my table wants a refill or ranch or bbq sauce, I am not leaving my hot food on the table to run back and forth getting it, and for all of that, I am extremely grateful, I appreciate what you do and I am going to tip you for doing it because that night, you are my HERO!!! \n\nSigned, \n\nAn exhausted Mom \xf0\x9f\x98\x8a"
b'I could add forty things to this list, but I\xe2\x80\x99m down over a bottle of wine and I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid it would be incomprehensible. '
b'Whenever someone whistles or snaps at me I hop over to them with my tongue hanging out and shout \xe2\x80\x9cMaster!. Are we going for walkies at the park!?\xe2\x80\x9d Before they can answer I turn around and walk away muttering loudly \xe2\x80\x9cProbably the vet again anyway...\xe2\x80\x9d'
b"And if I'm a customer and see you SNAPPING YOUR FUCKING FINGERS at a server, I will have no trouble giving you a piece of my mind, since your server probably won't. "
b"Cultural differences with regards to dining out can be alarming at times even though some stereotypes are true. Just try to remember that if you're ever considering ethnic places. \n\nMaybe your place developed a reputation within this community for being a place where whining gets you something. I'm from a very diverse city and one constant I find is that assholes come in all shapes, sizes, and colours. \n\nIf you're a lifer, remember that you have to get up tomorrow and deal with another asshole or two anyway. It's never worth dying inside over a bad day or two. If this isn't your career, get out as soon as you can and do virtually anything else instead."
b"I work at Texaslongback and tgichilibees \n\nAt Texaslongback the 86 list was every food item except soup, ice cream, and a single order of pork chops.\n\nAt tgichilibees we had two ncns on the line a day since Thursday. We ran a 35 minute Salad it was hell.\n\nAnd today is president's day! And in many places children dont have school all week.\nI'm glad I decided to Just work a silver rolling shift at longback today. "
b'Twining! I did decent, but my last table (very specific; extra dressing on the side, lite ice, oregano on the side, red pepper flakes in a ramekin, etc) ended up tipping me $40 on an $80 ticket. Stoked. They were standoffish at first, but after a joke they joked backed and hell yeah. Thank you unknown persons for making my night go from a 160 night to a 200 night. Yaaasssss'
b"As a past ski hill restaurant worker all I can really say is I feel your pain. President's week is hell on earth. You just gotta stay strong and know at the end of the week it's all over. The resorts I worked at were in Canada and it seemed that we just got shipped the rudest Americans possible every year. Maybe 25% of them tipped and if they did it was like 10% at best. [Good luck.](https://imgur.com/gallery/5Yjpz) "
b"President's week, one of winter's hell weeks.    \n\nNo organization means upper management has no clue, so just hold your head up, look the other way, and focus on your tables, and your tables only.       \n\nLet management worry about the others, it's not your job. "
b'I went in yesterday two hours early and got the menu down, the chefs were very pleased.  However, the fine dining staff apparently hates me (or anyone they try to add to serving there).  They didn\xe2\x80\x99t give me tables until right before closing, then triple sat me.  Then they went home and I ended up as the closer when I opened.  Second night in a row of being there for 10 hours and not making money.  I made the decision to try to go back to the restaurant I liked in the resort that has a great team, I\xe2\x80\x99m hoping to get it approved today!'
b'First, what a stupid fucking owner. He is one that deserves to not be in business. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure his heart was in the right place, but clearly his managerial skills are nonexistent. \n\nSecond, people tip based on the final bill amount. If the bill was $500 and they give you a $450 gift card, you\xe2\x80\x99re getting X% tip based on $50. \n\nThird, his scheme should\xe2\x80\x99ve included, \xe2\x80\x9cAny complaints will result in a full-price meal.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nFourth, you should\xe2\x80\x99ve quit. '
b"That is the dumbest fucking scheme I have ever heard of. \n\nLet's open up and just give ALL the food away for free. No just a free app per table. Not even a BOGO entree deal. All the food. For. Free. \n\nJFC, the house must have lost so much goddamn money and I doubt the majority of those who were chomping at the bit to get in the day will ever return for full price. Coupon clients are the bane of restaurants. Once you establish your store as one who *does* send out coupons or deals, most people aren't going to come back until they have *another* coupon or deal lined up. \n\nPoisoning your own fucking well."
b"I'm gonna tell my boss this idea just to see the look on his face lol. What an awful idea. That's their money as well just walking out the door for free. That's not gonna help them at all. \n\nI've also found just because people get something free, doesn't mean people tip better. Shit, you can do every single thing possible for a table minus wiping their butt for them and guess how much you get? $2 if your lucky.\n\nI'm really sorry you all had to go through that. Goodness."
b'OMG, I can\xe2\x80\x99t even...wtf...help...I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to go on. The profit on food is low enough, you hope to make it up in booze sales. FREE FOOD is a disaster. There is so little money in food, that is my experience from working in restaurants for 20+ years. Unless the supplier screws up and gives you baby back ribs for the price of end cut (which happened to us and we took full advantage of) you have to be very careful on food prices. Get them in for the food, but make them stay for the booze. Even with all of the taxes on booze it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to make money. I am in a small town, so we need to keep things reasonably priced or you\xe2\x80\x99re deserted. It\xe2\x80\x99s a shitty business.'
b'"You\'re a manager, right?"\n\n"Act like one."\n\n[I\'m a bad person to listen to. I can be your best employee *or* the leader of the rebellion. I have no compunctions about breaking bullies, standing up for what I believe is right, defending team-mates & cultivating a team dynamic...and if it comes down to it I\'ve never been afraid to tell someone to go fuck themselves and walk.]\n\nGood luck, they sound like real pieces of work.'
b'Try reporting annonymously to your HR, make sure you have some colleagues to back you up/report as well if needs be, the more complaints the better. Sadly not a lot else unless the company records audio, which i think is illegal in most places now'
b'ohh it pisses me right off when managers behave like that. had a manager do it to me for a few years before i started biting back, and he couldn\'t do shit bc i had ALL THE WITNESSES. as well as cameras (this particular guy liked making faces so you clearly see who started the ordeals) and whenever he tried it with the \'fresh meat\' as he liked to call them, i physically stepped between them, put a barrier for the other person, distract the idiot from his words, and give him a look that he knew meant shit was going to go down if he didn\'t shut up. it didn\'t help much when i wasn\'t around, but the more i did it the more others did too. eventually he made good workers quit and every single one of them said he was the problem and head office got their head outta their asses and fired him right before i quit. unfortunately he likes brown nosing so us complaining didn\'t do much until we all started quitting.\nhe tried getting me fired a few times too, but since no one else had any problems with me, and i ended up being one of their better senior staff, i was kept as long as i wanted. (i ended up quitting for a better job)\n\n\nbut yeah, if your not up to being mildly confrontational about that type of behavior report to the direct boss of the manager (you can request to be anonymous, or send anonymous messages)  and if that doesn\'t work keep at it, get more people to report that, especially the girls they are talking about. request to have better workplace bullying policies in place. and make a log of what they are saying, and when too, just in case someone asks for, say evidence and such, you can present your logs with date and time and who said what all organized. try and gather as much evidence as possible, and make sure the main point of your argument is that type of behavior is NOT acceptable in a work environment about a *minor*. if someone tries to counterpoint with a "but" just keep repeating the fact it is not ok about a *minor*. \n\nbut if it truly upsets you, always at least try contacting the higher ups, and keep trying. dont just become disheartened after the first few knock-backs. eventually someone *will* listen and hopefully deal with the situation.'
b'This is a long story, and im apologizing in advance. Summary at bottom. \n\nIve only had one time where I had to refuse to serve someone. It was an old man (literally late 80\'s) and he was a regular. He came in at least twice a month, and was always a nightmare. For starters he refused to be waited on by a male server. Like would start yelling and freaking out if a man tried to take his order. He was pretty much always rude to whatever server he got, aside from the 82 year old lady who still works there as a waitress. He fancied her I guess because she never got the treatment the rest of us got. He would cut you off mid sentence, yell, curse, order off menu/insane/weird requests (keep reading for a great example) and get livid if you suggested anything that was not verbatim what he barked at you when you approached the table. Now keep in mind I was used to this treatment from him already because I had waited on him 20 times in the year and a half I worked there. Most other waitresses refused to serve him for various reasons. This particular day though it was out of control, and my male manager did NOTHING to rectify the situation. \n\nHe came in 20 minutes before closing time on a Sunday (our busiest day) and it was only me, a male server, and my male manager left. Naturally he wanders in and by default I get him because he will yell if a man tries. I walk up and smile, set a menu down, and ask what he would like to drink. (He hates small talk, and wants as little contact as possible as stated on prior visits.) He immediately picks the menu up and throws it across the table at me and yelled "I dont need no fuckin menu, ive been coming here for 20 years! Bring me orange juice in the small glass!" Before waving his hand for me to leave. I said "okay, I\'m sorry sir." and take the menu away to get his damn juice. He has asked for a menu in the past because "he\'s old and cant be expected to remember such a large menu" in his own words on a previous night. Literally 2 minutes go by and I\'m approaching the table with his small juice. I set the juice beside him and ask if he was ready to place his order. He then proceeded to loudly ask for a bowl of vegetable beef soup, with out any beef or green beans in it (broth with carrots basically), piping hot, in a styrofoam cup. There better not be "any god damn greenbeans" in his cup. He would like to finish that, and then a BlackBerry cobbler hot with a small milk. Little weird, but he\'s old so I nodded, said "yes sir, ill have that right out." And went to ask my manager the best way to ring that in. I ended up having to spend 5 minutes with a spoon picking out all the beef and green beans from a bowl of soup, microwaving it until it was steaming hot, and then pouring as much as I could fit into a styrofoam cup for this man because at this point the kitchen is closing and they weren\'t gunna do it. It was less than a 10 minute wait between when I placed his order and when I brought it to him. I set it down and he scowled and waved me away again. I didnt even say anything and walked off. Fastforward about 15 minutes and we arent taking new tables because we\'re closed but had several that came in last minute. He has half a cup of broth left, but hasnt touched it in 5 minutes and is simply staring around looking displeased. So naturally I go over and ask "Was everthing allright sir?" On man, wrong move. He pushed his chair back from the table and literally starts yelling and cursing "Why can\'t you damn waitresses ever leave me the fuck alone, I didn\'t come here to talk to you people, I come here to sit and Fuckin eat!" At this point this was the second time he yelled and cursed, and he has acted this way in the past. I do not like being talked to in that manner by anyone, and spoke up. "Sir, can you please not curse at me? I havent spoken to you that way, and there are other customers that might not like that kind of language-" Wrong move #2. He cuts me off there and continues yelling "I\'ll use whatever language I damn well please, get the fuck away from me!" Before promptly scooting back up to the table and back to his soup cup. A young couple with a toddler a few tables away actually got up and walked out because of his outburst. At this point I\'m annoyed because another table has left my section because of him. I walked off visibly frustrated and told my manager what had been said and that I had lost a table because of him. Also told manager that I wasn\'t going to deal with being spoken to in that manner that it was uncalled for. He basically told me to deal with it and finish serving him, he wasn\'t going over there. Now due to some previous bad experiences I have very bad anxiety when im yelled and cursed at in that manner, and wasnt handling it well at all that night. So behind the line out of sight of customers I did tear up a bit because I was frustrated, anxious, had been there 10 hours already and it was now 30 minutes past closing time and I wanted to go home. Finally from my spot standing up front I see him push the soup cup away violently, though it still has a bit of soup in it, and starts waving at me. I take this as my que to get him dessert and heat up a cobbler and bring him that and his milk along with the check. (People pay on their way out) he says nothing to me upon dropping them off at the table. He spends another 20 minutes or so slowly nibbling his cobbler. At this point my ride has been waiting outside for 30 minutes, and its just the dishwasher, the manager, and me left. I once again aproached my manager and begged him to let me transfer the table to him, tell him that the man has the check but I didnt wanna have to talk to him again, and even offer to let him keep the tip if he left one. He literally had to do nothing but take this mans payment at the front counter, something he was already having to wait on to count the money for the night. He snapped at me, and told me "You over react all the time" and that I wasnt good at my job. The old man ended up snapping at me one more time when I offered him a lid to take his soup home, and it took every fiber of my being not to quit and walk out. The real kicker is the next day at the end of my shift my female manager pulls me aside with a write up sheet from the previous day, asking my take on what had happened the night before. My male manager had went to the owner that night and told the owner I had an attitude with a customer because I was angry I had to stay past closing time, and that I had escalated the situation and then got an attitude with him. When I heard that I broke down in tears and explained everything I wrote out above. My female manager was appalled, having waited on this man before and knowing exactly who I was talking about. She tore up the write up, and told me that I no longer had to wait on that man and was allowed to refuse to serve him in the future if he came in again. He actually was banned alltogether from dining inside shortly after for making another waitress cry. \n\nSummary- Old man came in often, and was always a pain in the ass. One day things got a little out of hand, and he had Several outburst where he cursed/yelled at me. Cost me another table, and kept me 45 minutes past closing time. Tried to refuse to serve him, and male manager tried to write me up for it. Female manager dismisses write up and bans man shortly after for habbit of yelling and making waitresses cry. \n\n'
b':O   \nHoly fuck. Ive never denied serving a table, but fuck. I feel like you left out a lot but felt passionate about this to post. If, forbid, this happened to me, I would transfer the table and split tip depending on how much time was spent with the table.  \n\n\nBut for real, some tables just suck. I got shafted on a 88 dollar ticked because I didnt "refill" their grenadine cokes every 2 minutes.  \n\n\nSome tables suck.   \n\n\nIf I get that vibe from a table, its like, whatever, I did what I could. Turn in and give them what they want (within reason). Accept it as a loss and turn that shit quick. I am all about making sure these people have a unique and great night, but sometimes you gotta cut your loss.   \n\n\nI, personally, would never refuse service unless they mentioned harm or something that would harm or effect the rest of the staff. Turn them quick. These assholes exists, we just gotta move on.. unless its some real shit   \n\n\nIf I think im not getting a tip due to very obvious reasons.. put them on the lower end of the totem.  I have tables that give a fuck and youre over here complaining that the lasgna wasnt hot enough when I just pulled it out of the window.   \n\n\nBruh, no. GTFO with you trying to be cheap.   \n'
b'If only everyone had to work a fast food job before they moved up to another job, then everyone would be kinder to those people, knowing what it\xe2\x80\x99s like to have that job. I worked at a \xe2\x80\x9cnicer\xe2\x80\x9d fast food place for over a year, so I try to be respectful to restaurant workers when I go out to eat because I understand how crappy it can be to work in a place where customers and management get mad at you for silly little things.'
b'I was in almost the exact same position, except my GM was great and stood behind me. Our problem was our DM, he shut down just about every idea we came up with to try and hire more people and at the same time berated us for being understaffed. I was the same kind of manager, I did FOH schedules and stood up for my staff as much as I could. At the end of the day it was the biggest reason why I quit, nothing was ever good enough for the DM, I was putting too much of myself into the job. I\xe2\x80\x99d find myself crying almost the whole drive home (around 40 min) because I just felt like I was failing the store and staff. \n\nIf I can give you any advice honestly it is to just keep supporting your staff like you are. If they know how hard you go to bat for them they will back you up in end. If your GM doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like who you hire I would talk them and just say, \xe2\x80\x9chey, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t like who I\xe2\x80\x99m hiring I\xe2\x80\x99d be more comfortable with you just doing the interviews.\xe2\x80\x9d If that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work go to your DM, RM, or whoever is above your GM. But when you do this it has to done without seeming like you\xe2\x80\x99re going over GMs head. An email or a phone  call to them saying something along the lines of, \xe2\x80\x9c hey we\xe2\x80\x99re having trouble finding viable employees, do you have any interview strategies that will help us find the right people?\xe2\x80\x9d  And never complain down, I know how hard it is when staff comes to you to complain, just remember to be supportive and don\xe2\x80\x99t put down your superiors in from of other employees. Hope it all works out!'
b'I really wish more managers had your outlook and mentality. You\xe2\x80\x99re a good manager and I don\xe2\x80\x99t even know you but I appreciate you!!!'
b'Fellow manager here, sounds like you are not a good manager but a great one! I can only imagine despite work frustrations, your employees really feel good about working for you. It\xe2\x80\x99s also important to realize you can\xe2\x80\x99t make the job perfect. The food industry is STRESSFUL, it\xe2\x80\x99s also a job and is never going to be an awesome, totally fair walk in the park (like all jobs, it\xe2\x80\x99ll suck for you and your staff a lot).\n\nDo you have to get hires approved by corporate? If not, trust your gut and just hire on good vibes. It\xe2\x80\x99s not gonna work out with everyone, but you don\xe2\x80\x99t know without trying if you can of course. Manager at independent restaurant here, with a lot of freedom of hiring, firing etc. so my situation is different. We hire 3 people at a time and expect to hold onto one great server. You can\xe2\x80\x99t tell by interview/app alone if you can convey that to higher ups.\n\nKeep up the great attitude! You rock! '
b'I know what you mean, my first DM trusted and respected anything we brought to the table. He would always give words of wisdom and encouragement, so when this DM took over it was a shock to the system to be immediately put down for everything we were doing. And I do mean everything. It\xe2\x80\x99s so disheartening to be put down and feel second rate. Just know we\xe2\x80\x99re all here for you. Keep your chin up!'
b"Out of my 3 managers one is like you and I wish all my shifts were with him. We all respect him so much more than our other managers because he has our backs, he pitches in without complaining, thanks us for working so hard and doesn't berate us for making mistakes like our other manager does. I respect him so much that like I always do my best and try to go above and beyond because I don't want to disappoint him. I'm sure your employees feel the same, like letting her cry and taking care of her section was awesome of you. Trust me, your servers love you."
b"I served chicken parm to a Muslim vegan couple. Legit wrote it down as chicken parm. Ughhhhh. It was supposed to be eggplant parm.  THEY ATE SOME OF IT BEFORE TELLING ME. I was next to them cleaning booths while they were eating it  and they didnt stop and be like yo this doesnt look like eggplant. I'm pissed at myself bc it was high volume and I fucked up. But dude, you  you said you all eat here all the time. The eggplant and chicken parm look SO DIFFERENT. I got them their food with extra sides and all the apologies. I accepted my shitty tip with grace. They HAD said eggplant and I was on autopilot at the time and wrote down chicken. Bleeeeeergh. \n\nI fed vegans chicken and they ate it. Being a 3 year vegetarian I know how much that shit can fuck up your bowels. Table I will never see again... I'm sorry I broke your trust. Ughhh. "
b'I suspect the word is "douchecanoe."\n\n(Though I guess whoever wrote it down might think "vegan" and "vegetarian" are the same thing? My dad does that and gets a little salty when you try to explain that there\'s a difference and it\'s important sometimes.)'
b'Hey! Congrats on finishing your first day! \n\nDon\'t be so discouraged just yet. It\'s your first day out of training, and mistakes will happen. Just keep your head up, keep trying, and do what you can. This will get easier as you get used to it. \n\nFrom how you described your work and the atmosphere, maybe the tagline is "Pleasing People"? If so, don\'t worry. I used to work at that place. The vast majority of the guests are nice people who tip well. Much better than my other serving jobs lol. \n\nNow, with the couple you missed. That\'s happened to me multiple times. It does to everyone! Don\'t beat yourself up about it. The manager shouldn\'t have went after you because of it. It\'s his job to make sure you\'re doing well and not overwhelmed. Something that might help you is if you see a guest looking around, just drop by and ask if they need their server. Or like my last job, swing by with a water pitcher and offer a refill! Usually guests will say what\'s wrong if someone just drops by. Don\'t let this bother you. \n\nWith the second one, that happens all the time as well. People can be absolute jerks. After you drop the ticket, it is not your responsibility. You can\'t control other people, and there was nothing you could\'ve done differently. \n\nDon\'t let this get you down. Some of my best and worst days were at serving jobs. The first few weeks kinda suck while you try to find your rhythm, but you will! I hope your next shift goes much better for you. \xf0\x9f\x98\x8a'
b'As a manager, I had someone that had already ordered try and hit on some girls, they were not having it so I took another employee with me to speak to the young man about leaving other guests alone. The young man felt the need to put his hands on me, okay not cool dude, then he put a hand on my employee, and that\xe2\x80\x99s when the cops were called. Just touching unwanted was enough for me to call the cops. The young man did not get his food, he did not get a refund, and he went to jail. Fun side note, pulling out your military ID does not help when you are dealing with a veteran, I did not care and the cops did not care. Act better because you are in the service of our country, do not act worse. '
b'given the likelihood of managers succumbing to customers; if you\xe2\x80\x99re ever pushed, shoved, punched, slapped etc. play it like a soccer player would - act it up like they just fully assaulted you (which they did, legally) and feel free to fall down and play the situation up so that shitty managers can\xe2\x80\x99t do what they did in this scenario. '
b'I would have called the cops, and had her charged with assault. Then I would have reported my manager to whoever is,above him, and the labor board.'
b'This is assault. Call the police. '
b'If I was there I would have punched her for you. I\xe2\x80\x99m so sorry :( As a customer I will never truly know what restaurant workers go through, but keep your head up \xf0\x9f\x92\x95'
b"I have been a server for 15 years. At my last job, I was assaulted two nights in a row, spoke with a police officer, it was 3rd degree assault! My boss promised to handle it after watching video surveillance of the incidents, and then had the opportunity two nights later to approach the man, and he did nothing. When I found out, just before I went to work a couple days after he did nothing, I mentioned the legal ramifications of the ordeal to my manager. 30 minutes later the owner came in, SCREAMED in my face cussing me out, and fired me. He also put his hand on me to push me towards the door. It's absolutely insane. It took me weeks to process what had happened!"
b'I wouldve called the police and pressed charges for assault. Idc what anyone says. You have rights'
b'Next time call the cops. Your boss cant stop you from pressing assault charges.'
b'I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry you this has happened to you. Under no circumstances that this was your fault. Your manager is a shitty person and you need to leave this shitty establishment. If your manager won\xe2\x80\x99t even defend you when you\xe2\x80\x99ve been shoved, what would they do if something worse were to happen? I hope you\xe2\x80\x99re able to find a better job and leave asap. Good luck!'
b'Great and now this customer will think they can just go around shoving people whenever they\xe2\x80\x99re inconvenienced. '
b'I hate spineless managers who let customers abuse their staff just so they can make a couple of bucks.'
b'Holy shit I\xe2\x80\x99m so sorry! Sometimes this sub makes me feel better, like I\xe2\x80\x99m not alone and other times\xe2\x80\x94 like now\xe2\x80\x94 it makes me so mad! Grrr!'
b'Free meal?  That\xe2\x80\x99s so wrong she should have gotten assault charges!!  So sorry!'
b"I work as a host full time and I swear, sometimes people are meaner to us than the servers. They act like wait times are our fault, and since you don't really move around, you're an easy target to throw hate at.\n\nThat being said, I have NEVER had someone put their hands on me like that, and I know if they did my manager would have them thrown out immediately. We're just trying to do our job. Your manager should be damn ashamed of themselves. Valentine's has people already volatile so they might not want to have caused more of a scene but that's no excuse!"
b'I also work at a breakfast place, hours 6-3. You are so right!! My last job was at a Jewish Deli where the customers were unbelievably difficult but it was nothing compared to this new place. I\xe2\x80\x99m so sorry that happened to you. Fuck those people. I had a table yesterday who\xe2\x80\x99s bill was 52.00 and they left me 48.00. Fun times.'
b"It's called assault and it's illeagal, you can call the police and have them permanently ban, otherwise your employer is creating a hostile work environment."
b'Thats terrible. I have no idea what advice to give you on that as i don\'t host, i did host at a chain for a little while like a decade ago, but yeah.. not my forte as we don\'t have to do any hosting at my current job.\n\nI would just try to be assertive but respectful.\n\n"ma\'am, the way this restaurant works" (you are educating the moron) "is that we have to have a clean table and ready server, before we can seat you. we have certain standards and protocols" (our hosts managers bussers and other staff wear head sets so if you do too you can point to it) "we all communicate to each other what is going on on the floor."\n\nIdk. I\'d love to embarass her tho. but politely and professionally, of course.\n\nAnd then of course, add on, if you work at a chain with secret shoppers, there are prolly more protocols im unaware of.\n\nIt cracks me up. People are utterly clueless on the server lifestyle. Like, they walk into a food restaurant, think "food" and associate it with like "mcdonalds", and assume we are uneducated morons, and thus treat everyone in the building like shit, when infact they have (obviously) never worked at a restaurant a day in their life, and don\'t even realize, like yeah, it takes actual active the entire 8 hour shift, active brains, to do this work.\n\nI need to tell the next piece of shit to apply and if they got fired, watch them fail. i\'d love it. just once.\n\n.in other words, people in an office get to take random breaks whenever, we are constantly using our brains the entire shift. just SAYING'
b"That's not right. Definitely go to the owner, or whoever is above the GM. "
b'Fuck\xe2\x80\x99em! You already gave to much energy to the person. Now you want affirmation? Fuck\xe2\x80\x99em. Get over it. This is your job. Assholes like this exist. Fuck\xe2\x80\x99em! \nSorry for the initial outburst. You\xe2\x80\x99re an amazing human doing people a task they have no appreciation for. Keep your head up! I wish could hug you and pass a fat joint, while saying \xe2\x80\x9cfuck those Putos\xe2\x80\x9d! You\xe2\x80\x99re doing great! '
b'I\xe2\x80\x99m a manager in the food service industry and I\xe2\x80\x99ll be goddamned if someone spoke down to one of my employees; much less someone physically assaulting them. \n\nThat would not fly in my coffee shop. The customer should have been removed immediately and the police should have been called. This legit pisses me off.'
b'Would of been better to smile, call the police. Have them review the tapes. And then arrest her for assault. '
b'Just dip, you deserve better. That fucking excuse for a manager will just throw employees under the bus! But remember to give that fucktard a piece of your mind!!'
b'Oh my God I almost downvoted you because I got angry.\n\nI\xe2\x80\x99m a server/FOH manager and I fucking PRAY for the day that someone lays a hand on one of my goddamned servers. I. Will. Be. Unleashed.\n\nThe biggest failure is def your manager/boss. That is never, ever okay. A business that relies on customers who assault their staff deserves to close.'
b"15 minutes? Cant say i'd have pushed anyone but i'd have left ten minutes ago.\n\nAnd as a former manager, i'd have also given that guy the option of leaving, or dealing with the nice officer i give free coffee to every morning. guess who he's gonna side with?\n\nnot sure what all the downvotes are for, but whatever helps you sleep at night, i guess."
b'Okay, it\xe2\x80\x99s the day after! You survived! Yeah you! \n\nNow shake it off and job hunt.  Some new place with better management will be very lucky to have you! '
b"Sorry to hear that. That's shit. You made it through and you hopefully remained professional, so what that means you either find a new job, or you go directly to the owner and explain the whole situation. If they don't offer to change anything (title, management, pay) be prepared to walk right there. It's a fend for yourself kind of industry, and he has to weigh his options cautiously. From an outside perspective, someone who is willing to do management positions without management pay deserves to be treated better.\n"
b'As soon as I saw that unfold on Twitter, I was all "yeah, /u/TalesFromYourServer is NOT going to like that". \n\nHe got strangers to pay his bill, took up a table all evening, and tipped badly. All for a joke that wasn\'t even funny.'
b'Oh thank god you fired the chef this had ro end with either him going or you...\n\nDoes he not realize he and the restaurant could face legal charges?  Knowingly giving someone an allergen is a crime.'
b'If I were "deathly" allergic to a very common food, I probably wouldn\'t go to restaurants.'
b"> warm Aussie summer's day\n\nSo, it was Dec - Feb? \n\nWhat are summer Christmas movies like? Do people go to the beach house instead of the cabin? \n\nAnd that chef shouldn't work in any field around people or food. "
b'$200 probably would not cover the cost of an epi-pen sadly.'
b'In the future, I\xe2\x80\x99d recommend just saying that it\xe2\x80\x99s a private party. But something tells me they would be mad if you answered like that as well. Don\xe2\x80\x99t get too worked up over it.'
b'Best answer to most nosy questions in the future, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nYou\xe2\x80\x99re fine, you were caught off guard and a persons first instinct is to answer a question directly posed. '
b'Someone needs to show him what "down and out villiany" really feels like lol. '
b'I work at a casino, so that happens pretty regularly to me. I just shake it off and wait for the next big winner to give me a big tip to offset it.  It\xe2\x80\x99s all about the averages so fuck the cheapskates who can\xe2\x80\x99t be responsible with their money. '
b'Tale from the customer here. I was at the Wynn once and I asked for a drink while my wife was on the slot machine beside me. I wasn\'t playing. \n\nThe cocktail waitress tells me that she can\'t bring me anything because I need to be playing. \n\nI tell her that it can be for my wife who didn\'t order anything. \n\nShe reluctantly agrees but only with the condition that I better be playing when she gets back. \n\nI put her dollar tip into the machine: "Sorry, you lost on this last spin, but at least I\'m playing."'
b'Worked a double. Morning was constant, not really busy but the tables wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t stop coming in. I had a really great night, even with ticket times touching 45 minutes for dine in because of takeout. The restaurant was packed. As soon as I started my tables with drinks, I let them know that food would be coming out much later and if they wanted anything to snack on (crackers/soup) in the meantime it would be on me. Everyone was patient. Everyone tipped generously.  Hopefully tonight goes alright because I know it\xe2\x80\x99ll be busy again. '
b"Aye, kitchen worker here. Not to put anyone down here, but I feel what you're sayin. A lot of kitchen workers feel the same way about FOH. "
b'I agree. Our tip out is 4% of total sales. Some nights I have to tip out $100 for a busser not doing his job. We even have to tip out when bussers aren\xe2\x80\x99t even there! Like sometimes during the day they won\xe2\x80\x99t have one and management uses the bus boys to always go run errands so we have to do everything ourselves, yet we still have to tip them out a ridiculous amount of money. It\xe2\x80\x99s honestly insane. Some of them get $600 a week just from our tips for going and driving around for managers or not doing their work. \n\nI will say I appreciate the bussers who do a great job, but we only have 2 who are good out of 6. It\xe2\x80\x99s very frustrating. '
b'Are bussers paid minimum wage not "server wages"?.\n\nI was a busser at 1 and only point in my life and I do believe I made minimum wage, not server\'s rate.\n\nI never would expect tips even as a young kid at 16.\nJesus, I am dating myself lol.\n\nI can remember working a Valentine\'s Day night shift as a busser at a very well known place that was basically the tip of a town, only ocean around it. It was a destination place.\n\nI did my job, I don\'t remember any of it but what I will remember all of the waiters and waitresses at the end of the night shaking my hand thanking me for doing such a great job helping them out.\n\nThose hand shakes were with money. I was the only one who took my job seriously and wasn\'t sitting and talking with everyone else.\n\nI walked out with $400.00 if not more.\n\nI tried to give it all back because I knew they didn\'t make the minimum wage I did.\n\nOh no honey girl, you keep that and work on buying your 1st car.\n\nI can remember being super upset cuz I was thrown to the wolves so to speak, I had asked for help numerous times answered with I will be right there.. \n'
b'Isolate the issues. Have managers address those issues. C doesn\xe2\x80\x99t do her share of sidework? Get mgr to observe her during a shift. If she\xe2\x80\x99s not during her share, manager can either get her to be more of a team player, or let her know she\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cnot a good fit\xe2\x80\x9d for the restaurant. One staff member not pulling her weight or accepting constructive criticism can pull apart a good team. One person always pulling out their phone will make all new people feel they can do the same. If the floor manager is not the type to address this, you may need to make sure team leaders or head waiters have actual authority. You sound like you\xe2\x80\x99re doing your best to make this place work better, but a newbie who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t understand you have authority and ignores you needs to be brought into the fold or let go. '
b"Awww. I'm sure you did your absolute best. I'd have hugged you as well. Server jobs can be really thankless and I honestly admire anyone that can do it. You're far better than I'll ever be.\n\nThere is no shame in tears. It's a normal, human reaction "
b'This is really on management. :(  You shouldnt have been so understaffed and management needed to step in more.'
b'I had a moment like this before. I was absolutely slammed and normally on a busy night my restaurant would have four servers so we\xe2\x80\x99d split up the inside into two sections and the covered patio with the music into two sections. Even with four sections it was still a decent amount of tables so with one person down it was absolutely madness.\n\n I had six tables already, two of them were groups of 6 and then I got sat another two top. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t handle it but there was no choice. Eventually I go to greet them and before I even get to the table I\xe2\x80\x99m on the verge of tears because I have like 10 other things that need to get done and you can hear the chef screaming \xe2\x80\x9crunner\xe2\x80\x9d. I start apologizing for the wait, asking if they have any questions about the wine list, and the gentleman gently grabs my arm. Now they looked like rough country people and both of them just kind of had resting bitch face so I\xe2\x80\x99m fully expecting to get my ass handed to me because I didn\xe2\x80\x99t greet them for a full five minutes. Instead he says \xe2\x80\x9chey, we\xe2\x80\x99re easy, here\xe2\x80\x99s our drink order and our dinner order, take a deep breath. Just get to us when you have time, it\xe2\x80\x99s okay\xe2\x80\x9d. Him being so freaking nice made me cry a little more. I felt like a stressed out toddler playing soccer or something and having a pep talk from my coach haha. I nodded, said thank you, and put their order in. Even though they told me they didn\xe2\x80\x99t need a lot of care they probably got the best service all night because them being nice just made me want to make sure everything was perfect for them. \n\nThat was a really rough night for me and I\xe2\x80\x99m so thankful that he said that. I know serving is seen as an easy job but when you\xe2\x80\x99re right in the thick of it, it feels like the world is on fire and especially when you have customers mad at you. \n\n\nAnother story about crying in front of tables...I was at that same restaurant when my mom first got diagnosed with stage iv cancer. The first week or two weeks after her diagnoses I would go to the bathroom and cry between greeting tables. I know it was obvious and the owner tried to send me home a few times but I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to be alone so I stayed. I stayed and continued to cry through my whole shift lol. Not my proudest moment but hey, missing out on money would only stress me out more. '
b'At my first serving job we had a day where every single seat was taken so I had 8 or 9 tables as well as 8 individuals sitting at the bar. I was hosting and serving because our host at the time was basically useless (she had decided if she didn\xe2\x80\x99t get to serve, then she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to work). In the middle of this rush I had an older man stand up at my table and start yelling at me about how his wife is diabetic and if I don\xe2\x80\x99t get the food to come out faster then she\xe2\x80\x99s going to go into shock or something to that effect. I ended up crying during the rant and then teared up at several more tables that day. \nFast forward 6 years and whenever I get that stressed I just remind myself that the night will end and it\xe2\x80\x99s not going to be forever. All you can do when it\xe2\x80\x99s that busy is keep moving and think ahead about your next task once you\xe2\x80\x99re finished with the current one. I\xe2\x80\x99m also in college now and it does make classes more difficult if you can\xe2\x80\x99t do homework at night because you\xe2\x80\x99re emotionally and physically drained from a busy work night. Hang in there though! It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t exactly get easier but you gain more coping skills the longer you do it. '
b"I'm sorry you had such a hard night. I hope that after you've had a night to sleep it off, the stress will fade. \n\nIt's unfortunate to work at a place that is either perpetually understaffed or doesn't know how to look at sales trends to help dictate staffing levels. \n\nYou are not the only one to break down and cry at work. I cried HARD after one shift as a server. It was a college bowl game morning, we opened an hour early and the manager thought we would get a couple of tables for it. It was just me and the bartender. Mgmt even offered breakfast that is typically only served on Sundays. We had 3 orders of breakfast available, and they were the first 3 orders of the day. I had an 8 top, three 6 tops, and eleven other 2-5 tops. It was one of the worst days I had. I couldn't even communicate to the server how he could help me when his shift started two hours later. I teared up multiple times in the kitchen that morning. \n\nI could go on and on. I managed for 5 years after I was a server and such, and I got pretty good at crying in my car on my way home. \n\nIt's okay to feel emotions. It's okay to feel stress. However, you are in a partnership with your employer. You help them, they help you. If they can't hold that simple promise, find somewhere else that will. "
b'Yes I cried in front of my table before too! It was back when I got my first serving job at a very fast paced restaurant. It was my first week on the floor by myself and of course it was very busy. I messed up with two of my tables and I was sure I was gonna get fired. I felt so stupid. My one table was just a woman and she was so annoyed with me and asked for a manager. This was the last straw. I was so upset I felt like such a failure. I ran to the bathroom because I felt the tears coming and I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t stop them. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be in there for long because I was busy. \n\nI walked out of the bathroom and dried my eyes and hoped it didn\xe2\x80\x99t look like I was just crying but it was quite obvious. The woman who was complaining about me to my manager saw my face and she immediately broke down her anger replaced with I guess guilt. She kept apologizing to me saying she didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean to make me cry and of course that made the tears run down again. I kept telling her it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t her fault because it really wasn\xe2\x80\x99t I gave her bad service and I explained to her that I was new and I was really sorry about the service and she was super nice about it. She still ended up giving me a nice tip and my manager comped a lot of her check. \n\nI felt really stupid but hey we have all been there. Waiting tables is not as easy as it looks and it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the last time I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever cried at work just the first time I did it in front of a customer. It gets better though! It\xe2\x80\x99s been a really long time since I have, serving really makes you have tough skin. I\xe2\x80\x99ve had horrible days since then and also great days too. '
b"Pretty much every restaurant I've served at, management was so cruel to the girls (servers), at least one a shift would be crying in the kitchen or trying not to lose it at the tables. I broke down once after boss told me I was a terrible waitress and wouldnt amount to anything ever. I've worked 6 places and all had cruel hate-filled owners /management.\n\nYou'd just take it cuz it's the business. "
b"Damn girl, I have been there!! I have both cried from breaking down from the stress of working doubles and being in the weeds, and just couldn't handle it anymore, and I've cried because of straight up assholes being rude to me.\n\nServing is fucking tough. I'm glad they were understanding. That sounds like a rough night. *hugs*"
b'It\xe2\x80\x99s true though, I made this universal gesture last night while explaining that I wanted the rest of my curry to go...\n\nBest part, it\xe2\x80\x99s so universal that they got it but they are the type of place that uses the clear disposable Tupperware for leftovers like a Chinese take out place packs soup.'
b"Because people suck.  Really though it's because there are usually a lot of closing duties that need to happen anyway, that's why there's a time when the kitchen closes and a time when the restaurant closes.  At some point it turns into whether or not management decides it's okay to ask someone to leave but most business play it safe and let people stick around vs taking the chance that the customer will freak out if you ask them to leave.  It sucks and there's not a lot of ways for the business to win.  Mainly it comes down to people sucking and having no empathy or just being completely clueless.  My favorite was putting the chairs on all the tables around them and making it super obvious that the only reason anyone is around is because of them."
b"It depends on the restaurant, the management, etc.  In general, you don't want to piss off your customers.\n\nI think the problem is, almost all restaurants merge two different times:  Last call/kitchen is closed, and when the customers are expected to be gone.  For example, if you are running a restaurant, and expect your employees to wrap up and get out shortly after 10pm, you make your last call at 9:30, and guests are told to wrap it up about 9:50 and out the door by 10.  Instead, most places simply say closing is at 10, but if they allow people to come in at 9:59 and order, they should expect that people won't be getting out until after 11pm."
b'You *can* kick them out, but if they\'re not ordering anything else and they\'re not causing trouble, it\'s probably fine to let them stick around while you clean up. I had that happen a few times when I worked security at my school\'s pub (specifically on days it was just a restaurant, no event) and nobody really minded; they were quiet, they knew they had to finish up, pay up, and go home, and we all got paid for the time we were there anyway.\n\nOf course, I was also there in case they did need to be kicked out, and while nobody ever needed to be kicked out for "bad" reasons, I did have to kick groups out because they were staying way too long. So really, the lesson is: at closing time, you start closing, and once you\'re done closing anyone still there gets the boot.\n\nFinal note: just to be clear, everyone is happier if patrons leave by or at closing and don\'t stick around as long as possible. The people who work there *do* want to go home eventually. If you don\'t want restaurant staff grumbling about you behind your back, don\'t stick around like that.'
b"Where I'm from (Ontario), guests legally have 45 minutes after last call to finish their last drink. So my last call is at 1:45am, which means my guests can stay until 2:30am until they are kicked out. "
b'Some places have kitchens that stay open right till the posted closing time, and give last call for drinks right at closing time. Some close the kitchens and give last call an hour earlier than the posted closing time. If the closing time is midnight and you\'re selling food/drink right up to then, kicking people out right when you close is rough. If you stopped selling things at 11, it\'s more reasonable. I think things would be better if places posted their "last call" or kitchen closing times in addition to their "GTFO" times so that everyone would know what to expect. That\'d remove the ambiguity for people who don\'t already know which kind of place they\'re in.'
b"The higher ups in the company that get off at set time every day don't want to appear ungrateful for the guests patronage. That's basically it. \n\nAnd also because people suck."
b"I definitely find a way to mention when we closed, then that we are closed like 10 minutes after close. I give people about an hour because there's other work I can be doing (we have a lot of closing side work at my job) then I start loudly pushing in chairs, turning things off, etc. After an hour and a half I start taking things off their table. Some people still don't get it though. "
b"It's an upgrade over check yourself before you wreck yourself."
b"Not illegal since you guys make real minimum evidently, however it is shifty. Probably throwing this money into the labor budget to be able to give everyone fair wages though. I've seen a few stores run like that. "
b'I totally agree. I worked last night. My managers hyped it up because it was Valentine\xe2\x80\x99s Day And we had a lot of reservations, mostly people who had never been to our restaurant before. \n\nI got shorted by 2 tables, and the rest of my tables for the most part didn\xe2\x80\x99t tip more than 10%. I also work at a steakhouse, not inexpensive. \n\nI would like to add that holidays are overrated and attract very cheap people.\n\nOverall, our regulars aren\xe2\x80\x99t tipping as much as they used to, even though our prices and service haven\xe2\x80\x99t changed.\n'
b"I would say most people where I am tend to tip 20-ish% on the food when they're happy with the service, and it gets more unpredictable on drinks. Some people just tip the same percentage on drinks as they do on the food, and some tip a buck a drink regardless of what it costs. That's the big split I've observed, anyway.\n\nEdit to add: I live in a place where draft beer typically runs about $8-$10 per pint, wine is usually on the order of $10-$12 per glass, and cocktails are generally $10 for highballs, $12-$15 for something fancier."
b"I've found that it really is just a case by case situation. Within a shift I always get a huge fluctuation of tips, always have.\n\nEdit : holy crap I just realized who's post I commented on! What's up home-slizzle! See you Thursday! "
b'I worked last night, my bosses gave me the vip table, also handle with care, and one other two top to start. 7 course meals. I could of taken one or two more tables, but I\xe2\x80\x99m not a huge fan of vday. Anyways my two top tipped me 65$ on 270. And I auto gratuity the vip table for 150$.  (20% of bill). I usually get good tips regardless of the day or size of the party. You have to be genuine, just smile, seem happy to take care of them. Make sure they enjoy there meal. I live in Orange County California as well. Money isn\xe2\x80\x99t a issue for people paying 500$+ a night to stay in a regular room at my hotel. I guess it\xe2\x80\x99s just the area. '
b'Our AM bartender called out, and since I have a tiny amount of training (like, 3 days before I decided I hated it and stopped training) I was put on the bar. I work a double straight through so I\'m expecting to be relieved by around 4:00 to go on the floor for another 3-4 hours, which isn\'t too bad. Our lunch shift was pretty manageable. \n\nWell, 3:30 rolls around and I pick up the phone and it\'s the AM bartender who called out. The PM bartender who is supposed to be here in half an hour is her friend and she needs her to drive her to the hospital. They share a car, apparently. IDK. So now the AM bartender has fucked my day up on two occasions because I need to cover the bar for the evening too, and we get *SLAMMED*. The host didn\'t show, so when people walk in and see that no host is attending stand, they often grab a menu and sit at the bar because there\'s "no wait". Great. So I\'m now serving like, 20 different people and being a fucking milkshake maker for the rest of the restaurant and of course the ice cream machine is having issues. \n\nThis is why I didn\'t like the bar. I get too busy to actually give guests the best experience I can give them. I\'m lucky if I\'m able to check in on them before they finish their meals. And on Valentine\'s day I just felt like shit that people didn\'t have an awesome dinner here when I know I\'m capable of making that happen under normal circumstances. \n\nI\'m pretty fed up with the management here. A few employees not being great is one thing, but when the majority of the staff is late, doesn\'t show, doesn\'t help other servers, or can\'t do their job without being babysat, it\'s Management\'s fault for allowing that to happen. I just want to work with people who want to do their job. '
b'I worked lunch shift this morning and we were quite slow. '
b'All my tables were pretty chill except one. At the resturant I work at we have an all you can eat salad bar and the rule is that, because its unlimited, you cannot share your salad bar with other people. \nSo i caught my three top white had only ordered one entree and an add on salad bar sharing with the rest of the table. I told them that it was our policy that salad bar cannot be shared and the guy chewed me out. I sent my manager to the table to handle it and they said I "harassed them" \nLuckily manager handled it but they camped in my section forever and gave me death glares everytime I walked by. \nFucking assholes'
b"I no longer wait tables, but I did say a prayer last night for everyone to survive today with grace, clean turnovers, kind customers (always a prayer!) and solid tips. Soak your feet and legs, rest for a while and enjoy what's left of the chocolate on the shelves. 50% off starting today! Now take a deep breath...the next headache is Mother's Day. eeeeeek"
b"I felt like dying. No tips or shitty tips, and had a dine dash and angry ppl for the wait and the , I know the other manager, etc\nI don't care about other manager because they gonna get fired soon anyway! "
b"Omg, it was the worst shift I've worked during my three years at the restaurant. We were busier than I've ever seen the place before, compounded by the fact that we started doing Doordash about a month ago and one of my coworkers who was supposed to show up didn't.  About four of my tables spent over $60 and didn't tip me because they had to wait 20 minutes for their sushi orders (since our single sushi chef was making rolls for almost every table in the restaurant, plus about 12 to-go orders). However, several of my tables were super nice and understanding, and one woman even left me a bracelet with a little heart on it and a nice note! Ended up leaving an hour after close, but I survived!"
b'All my tables were pretty pleasant. One however, they were amazing. Laughed at my stupid jokes, super friendly, all of it. And then I drop the check off and come back to cash them out. The lady then jumps up and is like \xe2\x80\x9clet\xe2\x80\x99s go talk in the front\xe2\x80\x9d and I\xe2\x80\x99m like oh shit, they want something comped or its his birthday too. No, apparently he pissed her off so bad that she just wanted to pay and leave him. Walked out without him. Oops.'
b"I'd say I'd love to go there to be a nice customer, but then you'd have to serve me too. "
b'The last restaurant I worked at, the policy was no scheduled doubles on a holiday.  They fed us, too. '
b"Valentine's day is 10/10 my biggest day of fear in the industry. Good luck, boo. You can survive this. Remember, worst case scenario it's just another day and won't end the world. Also remember, you can't be in the weeds if you just don't give a shit anymore (something that helps me to never get flustered/upset when a guest yells at me over absolutely nothing). Best of luck to all of the restaurant employee survivors on this day of love that fills us with hatred for the rest of humanity. "
b"Idk, Valentine's day is easy, I think. It's only 2 tops so there isn't a log jam in the kitchen from big parties and for the most part, people are doing it just because they feel they have to and are in and out fairly quickly. Lots of bottles/glasses of wine which makes service easy on the bartender. \n\nI guess it depends on where you work, and I remember when I worked at a chain steakhouse that it did indeed suck and there were plenty of couples where you just knew there was going to be a domestic violence incident that evening. Mother's Day is the real bitch wherever you work, followed closely by New Year's Eve. "
b'We are running a bunch of fancy specials tonight. My GM freaks out on even the slowest nights so I\xe2\x80\x99m not looking forward to working with him. He micromanages like crazy. He tried that with the head chef last time though and got screamed at. It was amazing. Don\xe2\x80\x99t fuck with chef you bitch.'
b'Lord, give us patience, cause if you give us strength, we are gonna give them dinner and a show by throwing them out the window. Good luck everyone!'
b'My favorite part about this time of year is seeing all the "secret" couples come in.  Like guys it\'s 1 pm on the day before Valentine\'s Day and you\'re exchanging gifts and being all cuddily while looking over your shoulder... Get some class. '
b'I hate the stupid Visa gift cards. '
b"We will pray for your soul. :)\n\nI have never in my life sent food back. I'm sure at some point I will want to because I still have some years left. That said, I will never EVER send a steak back for more cooking. That's just wrong. The redder the better. (I'm one of those rare / medium-rare steak gatekeepers.)"
b'Today was my only day off all week, heading to a gig and in my way to the station I got a call from work saying they need cover. Thought I could squeeze a couple of hours in and they were somehow the worst two hours of my life. Everyone was so demanding. \n\nBut just remember guys, we\xe2\x80\x99ve all seen worse. Good luck out there soldiers.'
b'This visa gift card situation is the WORST. it gets declined 9/10, and when you tell the customer they look at you like you\xe2\x80\x99re an idiot. When it finally does go through it\xe2\x80\x99s for a lower amount than what\xe2\x80\x99s on the card and they think you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to hustle them. My body gets filled with dread every time i see one on the check presenter '
b'Speaking of hot water with lemon, anytime sometime ordered hot tea, if we needed someone to make it, we said, \xe2\x80\x9cMFHT\xe2\x80\x9d \n\nMother Fucking Hot Tea\n\nTo take it one step further, I programmed our POS (Piece of Shit it was) to have a button for MFTH and it was $9 when the real price was $2.75. Someone punched the MFHT and forgot to change it....the lady actually paid the bill and didn\xe2\x80\x99t bat an eye. \n\nGood luck out there tonight!'
b'I just dont understand how people need so many refills sometimes! They almost never acknowledge it but I love the ones that do. Sometimes they\'ll say something like please just bring 2 at a time because I\'ll drink 1 right away." Thank you for saving me a trip! Or maybe they\'ll apologize right at the beginning of the meal saying they always drink about 6 diet cokes when they go out. Thank you for realizing you\'re making unusual requests and that you\'ll patiently understand if I dont check in as often as a multiple-refiller requries.\n\nFor everybody else, after the first two times I start asking if you want a refill instead of saying \'let me refill that.\' Solely because most people dont need more than 1 or 2.'
b"Best of luck to all of the brave souls waiting tables today!  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, a huge thank you to our server from last Saturday at a certain colorful crustacean place.  (I doubt she'll see this, but she was awesome.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;"
b' ***Illegitimi non carborundum*** !   Dont let the bastards get you down.  Godspeed my friends.'
b'We made plans to celebrate Valentine\xe2\x80\x99s Day on the 20th so we wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have to deal with all the crazy, but we have season tickets to a theater in our city and tonight is our night to go \xf0\x9f\xa4\xa6\xf0\x9f\x8f\xbc\xe2\x80\x8d\xe2\x99\x80\xef\xb8\x8f we didn\xe2\x80\x99t even realize until a few days ago because the vday plans were out of the way, gonna be a shitshow. '
b"I'm going out for a drink and a meal tonight with the BF, nothing extra or anything, and I know it's probably a hell night for most servers, please tell me whatever I can do to make a server's night just a bit better. Would leaving a lil chocolate with the tip be a good idea?    \n\nI'm getting winter cabin fever, I know it's a bad night to go out too, but thanks to you servers out there, good luck, hang in there."
b'Oh no... im about to go into work...'
b"If you're a single server on Valentine's Day, be sure to give every 2-top table extra onions on their meal to ruin their dates! Even if their plate doesn't come with onions, throw a heaping pile of onions on the side.\n\n^^^^^/heavy ^^^^^sarcasm"
b"Server for 6 years here - I'll be praying to the serving gods for you! St Patty's is in a month too, don't forget! I hate holidays.."
b"I was meant to work after scholl today, but I had to take a sick day because my granddad has been vomiting like no stop. I'm just scared they don't believe me since I'd tried to get the shift covered before"
b"Good luck, buddy. I'm almost working at least 12 hours tonight. I'll be fueled solely by caffeine and spite. "
b'Have to get drug tested for my new job next week. Almost done working here but 12 hour double today is my second to last day! Going out with a bang!'
b'My manager decided last minute to make me work a double (on shift rn) and I\xe2\x80\x99m really just praying for good tips to come through cause I will stab someone'
b'Everything will be okay, I work as a server at a Korean BBQ and I go to school And I feel your pain. When the day is rough I take a deep breath and relax, I never let my customers ruin my night. Happy Valentines and take care. '
b'last valentine\xe2\x80\x99s day, a few of the servers went into the back and passed a joint around. it made things better... for them '
b"Going to cook dinner or go to a non Valentine's type restaurant.  We are going to do Valentine's out on Saturday afternoon. But I've also been a waiter.  It's painful to the customers also. Hate going out on Valentine's or any of the other big eating holidays. "
b'I have to go in at 4:30 to close and I am trying to keep an open mind! I hope your double is filled with nice people that are happy and in love on Valentine\xe2\x80\x99s Day and no unhappy people. '
b'I quit my job and am going to manage a grocery instead. Tonight is my last battle in the service industry. It\xe2\x80\x99s gonna be a rough one. '
b'Good luck to everyone. I picked up a bartending shift after being out of the loop for 6 months. Feeling a little nervous. Remember there are cold beers waiting for us after!!!'
b"I'm closing tonight. I go in at five so hopefully it won't be too bad but you know how it goes"
b"I'm working my first Valentine's dinner tonight as a server. I don't know what to expect but I do work at a private membership only club/restaurant so hopefully the clientele will behave better than regular restaurants. Crossing my fingers for a good shift."
b'I was out with my girlfriend on valentine\'s yesterday, too. Let me tell you it was an amazing night in the restaurant due to awesome live music and a VERY sweet server Lady!\n\nThough, me and my girlfriend are very patient and understanding but even we were slightly irritated to have to wait more than an hour for our very first drink and then a total of 2 1/2 hours for our food. We didn\'t complain to the server at all as she was not responsible for the bad time coordination that evening. We also didnt complain to anyone else as we both agreed we still had a fun evening and the food was great. \n\nThe only thing that I would have to complain about was, that when reserving a table 2 weeks prior, I was told that they had planned 2 shifts (4:30pm and 7:30 pm) so they could work it better. Now when we arrived however, they took a call right infront of us (a line behind us of about 8 people still waiting) and said to them "Yes, 8:30 we can manage for you". With the restaurant entirely full and people already waiting hours for drinks/food, I\'d say this shouldn\'t happen and you should stick to reservations only for such an evening.\n\nNevertheless, we tipped properly and were very grateful for how well our server lady handled the evening despite seeing the usual crazy finger snappers and glass wavers going at her (guy was annoying as fuck with his finger snap, he did it like 50 times non stop and that is not nearly overexaggerating). \n\nNote: English not main language, sorry for spelling/grammar mistakes.'
b'Oh yes, midrange restaurants staff get the worst tippers today, as it brings out the losers with no social skills that only go out once a year. Just like people that can\xe2\x80\x99t hold their booze on St. Patty\xe2\x80\x99s day, it\xe2\x80\x99s laughable. '
b'[Perhaps today IS a good day to die!](https://goo.gl/images/vxQYYC) '
b'Not the post I wanted to see an hour before my Valentine\xe2\x80\x99s Day restaurant shift \xf0\x9f\x99\x83'
b'While I am regretting not making holiday money, I am elated I am not working today. I go to school Tuesday and Thursdays, so those are my days off. Fuck white trash spending more than usual on dinner. No interest! '
b"I'm not from US, so VD isn't as bad here as it is there. That being said tonight was packed, basically no reservations cause 'its just two ppl we can fit in'- mentality. And working in a smallish restaurant I was the only one serving tables..\n\nBut customers were nice and in good mood, got more tips than during weekends usually (tipping isn't really that much of a thing here) So all in all a good day. \n\nHave a beer and relax, it'll be alright in the end :)"
b"Had to explain to my non industry boyfriend (he occasionally bartends at a dive bar/concert venue but never worked in a restaurant) why I wouldn't want to go out tonight even if I was off work.\n\nI was bartending tonight so I was saved from our worst customers, but we also barely had anyone at the bar tonight besides a few regulars, and I made nothing but LITs and margaritas for like 3 hours straight. We had this young couple come sit at the bar. My co-worker asked if they were drinking and if they had their IDs. The girl doesn't have hers, the guy is freshly 18. He tells them they can go sit at a bar table. They say the host told them to go to the bar. I thought they left. Turns out they got dinner, he smashed her phone and she threw the flowers he bought in his face and he left her with their (moderately low) bill. She sat in our lobby for a while trying to get him to come back to pay before she ran out. I followed her, mostly out of amusement, but the server said she'd rather have a $40 walkout than have to tip out. Which would have maybe been a dollar or two total but whatever. \nI'll take my even $100 and all the shots we took after, especially considering I personally had a stress free evening."
b'really appreciated this ! first day running food and really really tried my best oh well it can only get better '
b"I hate kids myself too, and I was just about to come here to tell you to calm down it's a one night per year thing, and to just let the kids have a bit of romance.\n\nBut damn, I knew kids now are shitty but I'd never realize it's gotten to the point where they don't know how to behave in front of their dates..."
b"So overall restaurants are pretty terrible to work on holidays, especially Valentine\xe2\x80\x99s Day. Tonight was no exception. I worked the night shift at a steakhouse and it was already crazy from earlier. As soon as I get to my section I\xe2\x80\x99m getting sat back to back. \n\n\nMost of my tables in the beginning were very nice and understanding. Then the fourth table arrives. It was another typical couple that seemed like they were going to be OK at first. The man orders alcohol and the woman just gets a water. \n\n\nThey both order steaks and were very particular about how they wanted it cooked.(no butter) .The man in particular ordered a sirloin and even picked the size out of the choices. Eventually the food comes out and my food runner is told that the man mistakenly ordered the wrong steak. On top of that, the women cuts the very edge of the steak and proclaims it\xe2\x80\x99s overdone.\n\n\nWhen it came to the mans steak, he tried to sound nice about it and acknowledged that \xe2\x80\x9cit was his fault. However this is when the story gets complicated. My manager wants me to ring in the new steak. As the new steak is starting to cook I come around the table just to check on them. The man says that he mistakenly picked the wrong steak again and it needs to be a Ribeye. \n\n\nAt this point I\xe2\x80\x99m running back to the kitchen trying to let them know before they start the previous steak. Again I have to ring in another steak.\n\n\nOnce the food is cooking I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking we\xe2\x80\x99re back on track. So walking by the table the man stops me once again to tell me oh you know I actually wanted my steak to be cooked this other temperature. Luckily it just needed to be cooked longer without wasting anymore product. \n\n\nThe meal is finally delivered by my manager. At this point I barely care anymore. My manager deals with them for a bit until the responsibility is back on me. At this restaurant, our pepper shakers are the ones you crank and the pepper is grinded (sic) up. This man is so perplexed why pepper doesn\xe2\x80\x99t come out as he shakes it like salt. I have to instruct the man how to use it and he still decides it empty. Fine, I can top it off in the back real quick. \n\n\nOnce I bring the pepper, they decide the baked potatoes were cold now. Fast forward to finally giving the check. After fetching special boxes, I drop off the check. The woman is expecting my manager to provide a discount (which unfortunately happened). I bring the new check, oh lo behold there\xe2\x80\x99s a coupon they want to apply. Go figure after knocking off the tab, I would of course get stiffed!\n\nThanks for letting me rant!\n\nEdit:text\n\nSorry, figured if I was going to read it I'd take the time to break it up a bit.\n"
b'I died. My back needs an asian lady to walk on it. I no longer feel my hips. I left work crying because we were short staffed and I was slow on service. I forgot about a coworkers tables when they went on break and they got yelled at. \nI forgot one of my tables to go order and they came back yelling at me. \nI was actually grateful for the campers. \nI didn\xe2\x80\x99t get to break all night and my boyfriend was waiting on me at home until I got off to start cooking a valentine\xe2\x80\x99s dinner... it didn\xe2\x80\x99t happen because I had a lovely group that didn\xe2\x80\x99t leave until 2 in the morning, and better yet, they tipped me .66 cents \xf0\x9f\x99\x83\nFor holidays now I\xe2\x80\x99m requesting them off because I\xe2\x80\x99m \xe2\x80\x9cout of town\xe2\x80\x9d '
b'One time we went to cold stone and my step mom got her I cream and there was hair. She took it back and showed it to the person behind the counter. She takes it back and the lady re-scoops some ice cream and as she had the 2 scoops hold this ball of ice cream up in the air, her and my step mom look and see like 15 long as fuck hairs in hanging from it. There was hair all through that bucket of ice cream. My step mom just got a different flavor and we were all fine. That lady in your story OP is a stuck up bitch. '
b"I don't have to work today since I'm not scheduled to work Thursdays, but my sister is and not only is it Valentines Day, it's also pouring cats and dogs, which means there's a LOT of customers who  are going to want to come in to eat a hot bowl of ramen. Though I'm not sure the V-Day crowd will want to come to a ramen restaurant since there's nothing romantic about eating ramen and where the staff shout Japanese phrases every 2 minutes whenever someone enters and leaves, lol. \n\n(thank god the only coupon we currently have though is one that's only accessible through a local city-wide retail app and that when the coupon expires it disappears from the app. We don't do physical coupons. So customers can't give us expired coupons)"
b'Not a server, but i\xe2\x80\x99m a valet in a restaurant and when you said \xe2\x80\x9ci didn\xe2\x80\x99t care it was only $3 because i just wanted to leave\xe2\x80\x9d that resonated with me on a spiritual level. It wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be the first time i stayed 4 or 5 hours after close to get a $2 top from a Maserati \n\nEdit: just finished the last car right now, tonight it\xe2\x80\x99s only an hour and a half after close and it was $3 from a Bentley. '
b'As a supervisor, we\xe2\x80\x99re trained to compromise and educate while serving the customers. I think the supervisor was right to allow a one-time exception, making the \xe2\x80\x9cone time\xe2\x80\x9d part clear, as it\xe2\x80\x99s not worth losing a customer over a $5 beverage. However they were wrong to kinda throw you under the bus by saying you may have made a mistake. I would have said something like, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry if there was some kind of misunderstanding, but there are no free refills on slushees. I will allow a one-time exception for you tonight to get one free refill, but in the future, there is a cost to get a refill.\xe2\x80\x9d I bet he\xe2\x80\x99s one of those guys who vows to never return but will keep coming back anyways. It sucks but we are trained to allow exceptions sometimes while also making sure the guest is clear on our policies moving forward. He probably wasn\xe2\x80\x99t paying attention while you were talking and mashed up what you said about free refills. His fault, but eating that cost is sometimes part of retaining business, unfortunately. However that\xe2\x80\x99s no excuse to throw an employee under the bus!'
b'Working in the service industry can be shit at times, but we can all sleep at night knowing we aren\xe2\x80\x99t inconsiderate assholes like above man. Also, lol at his life for having a melt down over a slushy. What a melt. '
b'Or at least mentioned that she also shorted you last time. '
b'Alright y\xe2\x80\x99all, an update for you. \n\nTonight they came back in, i was working lounge side again so would have had to take them. Said to myself in my head, no fucking way am I serving them. \nThe owner gets called over by them and apparently is told about what happened last night. Owner says that we charge after the 2nd refill, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter who you are or how often you come in, that\xe2\x80\x99s our policy now. I got completely backed up and the fuckers left, hopefully never to return. \nI don\xe2\x80\x99t think I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever been so happy. '
b"I'll never understand the managerial attitude that the customer is always right.\n\nIf every time someone comes in and they lose money, how is that good for business.\n\nMaybe I'll try that on the next oil change.  I had to wait 30 minutes for this so I want it for free or I'm never coming back again.\n\nAnd I want the next one for free too."
b"I have a similar story with two teenagers. They were both between 15-16ish and I try my best to give everyone great service. These girls ran me to death during the dinner rush in the busiest time of the year for lemonades refills, asked for extra sauces, and said everything was great and seemed happy. They got everything one one check then rounded the credit card slip up to the next dollar, which left me a whopping $0.34 on $43.66. I was pissed but busy so kept on keeping on. \n\nThe next day they come back and somehow they ended up on my section again. The look of shock and embarrassment on their faces told me these girls knew what they did and were too stupid not to come back to the same place the very next day. This time around though, they are getting $0.34 service. I stayed smiling and friendly but I did not check on them at all, I took their order, brought them a pitcher of lemonade, and ignored the empty pitcher of lemonade after they drank it all in the first 5 minutes, brought them their food with a fresh pitcher, told them to enjoy and walked away, didn't go back until it was time for the to pay. Imagine my surprise when the other girl pays this time and tips me $14 on the $40-something check this time. \n\nThe next day, they came in again and somehow I was their server again. This time I refilled their pitcher though and actually asked if everything was good, which it always is because we have great food. The first girl paid and left me 20%. \n\nI like to think they learned their lesson. "
b"I feel for you man. So many douchebags out there.\n\nWe feel like when we eat out we try to make up for assholes like that and tip way more than necessary. It's something that's been ingrained in my brain for I don't know how long."
b"> However, you have to understand what kind of douche you looked like when you asked for extra salad dressing after dumping the whole amount of dressing on the side on your salad.\n\nYou might have misunderstood the reason behind ordering the dressing separately. The guest might just have wanted to see what he is getting.\n\nAfter two separate occurrences of having a extensively rotten salad wedge under an nontransparent dressing (on happening at a restaurant where an average meal was around $120 last year) I do not accept things I cannot see anymore. Sorry. Cheat me once, you're an asshole. Cheat me twice, I'm dumb. No third time for me, I would have to hit my head with a hammer."
b'Glad you had a good V day! I did too! I had great tables and had a really fun shift! Im sure my turn will be soon to vent but yeah. Good day :)'
b'I enjoyed last night as well! Yes it was fucking crazy but I just got a serving position in a fine dining restaurant like a month ago and I really felt like I was on top of it. Or at least as much as you can be when your section is filled and you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to pour matching wine tastings with each course. I only had a couple tables tip me less than 18% and maybe I\xe2\x80\x99m a little bit of a masochist but I love serving when it\xe2\x80\x99s crazy. '
b"I'm pleased for you - I'm astounded that I'm off this evening, myself.  \n\nI appreciate that I'm not handling awkward first-date-on-Valentine's couples, long-term couples sniping and using conversation with me to passive-aggressively needle one another, and couples having a night out beyond their means who will inevitably make the price on the check the hill they will die on.  \n\nI'm spending the night at my corner bar reading Valentine's Day horror stories on this sub and commiserating with the bartender.  Apparently I don't know what to do other than be industry on 'holidays'."
b"Telling me how good a job I'm doing and small praise for accomplishments really keeps me going. I know I work hard, but hearing that my manager/coworker sees and appreciates it always makes my day a bit better."
b"Doing small little things for your staff goes a long way. When I open sometimes one of my managers will already have done one of my opening duties (takes like, 5 minutes tops) but it makes me know they're thinking about me and wanted to help me out. \n\nYour team will have your back if you have theirs. Comping off every check from every guest who is the slightest bit upset is a great way to show your team that you don't care about them. Obviously sometimes you have to comp something. But don't be a pushover. People will walk all over you if you let them. \n\nAnother thing that usually gets us motivated it small little contrets. Who can sell most appetizers or deserts per table. Winner gets a $20 gift card. \n\nIt sounds like you're doing it right. "
b'I\'m going to go off the beaten path, and I know lots of people will say things along the lines of "praising and reassuring when I\'m doing something good." However I don\'t entirely see how that\'s beneficial. In fact, consciously asserting praise can seem disingenuous. Almost like it\'s a manipulation tactic: let me say something nice about Employee so that their moral will stay high.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYes, my shitty GMs typically only pointed out things they wanted me to do better and not when I was doing a good job, unless it was once in a blue moon and even then, it sounded like a conscious effort.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor me, having a polite demeanor is kind of the biggest thing. We\'re a team. Supervisor or not, I couldn\'t do this job without you, and you couldn\'t do this job without me. So I guess... respect? Equal playing field? That\'s the big key, personally. Not acting like head honcho hot shot all the time.'
b'I love it when my managers just help me. At my old restaurant we didn\xe2\x80\x99t have a manager for a while and the owner (who was kind of our manager) would often sit down with his friends and drink wine and watch us all run around like crazy on busy nights. At my new place, if it\xe2\x80\x99s slammed then my manager will basically take tables. Or ask if I need wine poured and run food for me. It just really makes me feel like they have my back. I hate asking for help because I feel like I\xe2\x80\x99m bothering them so I appreciate that they come to me first and ask \xe2\x80\x9cis there anything I can do for you?\xe2\x80\x9d. \n\nAlso, constructive criticism and praise. I know I have bad nights and if the manager feels like they saw something I could do better next time, I\xe2\x80\x99d love to hear that! On the flip side, I have really good nights where it\xe2\x80\x99s busy but I\xe2\x80\x99m still on top of things. I also love hearing that I did well! '
b'Diet is still better than non-diet. '
b'until I started reading this sub, which at this point was a long time ago but still, I had no idea that "hosts" and waiters/waitresses were separate entities, with separate duties. I just thought that seating guests in their section was part of a Server\'s duties.\n\nSo probably most people who haven\'t worked in a restaurant don\'t know either. Definitely will be a lot who do, and almost anyone who did work in one will know, but it\'s just not something from common sense. '
b"It depends on the stress...\n\nGood stress: it's a crazy night. I'm running around non-stop and barely have time to even think. But you know what, bring it on because I'm going to kick tonight's ass. Three hours just went by feeling like 20 minutes.\n\nBad stress: holy eff, we've had more than one person call out because of an emergency/illness. We are not prepared, I'm doing bartending, serving, takeout and managing. I'm ready to go into a corner and cry. "
b"I've worked for 4 different restaurants over a span of about 9 years. A lot of that time was spent at multiple restaurants at once. The current place I work... wow. It's amazing. The main thing I notice different here is that the servers ALL HELP EACH OTHER. If you are sat next to x, then you help x when you can and they help you. It has made the world of difference. So, focusing on team work has produced amazing results. "
b'1) great food, that brings in great clientele. 2) a professional staff, not these lazy turds everyone seems to employ these days. 3) a clean restaurant, I would not eat at the place I currently work part time at because it\xe2\x80\x99s always trashed because of lazy ass employees 4) of course money, but if you run a nice clean restaurant with great food, the money will be there. '
b'Wait, are you going to continue your day job AND run the restaurant?'
b'Avoid high turnover like the plague. One of the most successful local restaurants I know still had about half their original staff 12 years on.  \n\nIve seen restaurants get on a high turnover treadmill. You end uo expecting your staff to be shit and treat them as expendable. Its an ugly, miserable disaster.\n\nMake sure you have a mentor of some kind who has worked in your industry and area. If its the old owner thats great.\n\nBe prepared to fuck up sometimes. You will make bad investments. You will lose money. Learn from these mistakes. Trying to avoid this will kill your business faster than safe risks.\n\nAcknowledge you have fucked up when you have. That sets a good tone and a good example.  It makes it easier for your employees to acknowledge their mistakes and to bring up problems you need to hear about.'
b'Ive seen a lot of accidents/mishaps caused by small children on the loose in the places I\'ve worked but one was particularly funny. At my first restaurant job when I was like 15, i was at the end of the server aisle and on the other side near the restrooms there was this obese toddler just standing there swinging his arms around, no parents in sight (this was a good distance from any tables). Suddenly this server calls "DOOR!" then kicks through the swinging kitchen door rather aggressively with stacks of dishes and the door collides perfectly with the big ole toddler. Kid goes flying down the bathroom hallway like five feet and starts screaming while all the dishes end up on the floor, 80% broken. The server was mortified but the kid was so short he wasnt at all visible through the little visibility window in the door and he most certainly didnt know what calling door meant. He wasn\'t physically hurt at all but his parents probably made sure he stayed at the table within their sight from then on out'
b"One of my favorite memories of serving with those giant trays was watching a girl I work with heft it up on her shoulder and walk it to a table. A kid running out of the bathroom took a header straight into the tray. The kid was fine, tray and waitress were fine, but holy crap the look on that kid's face and his bewildered walk back to the table I can see better in my mind's eye than my entire four years of college. "
b'I cannot believe that you disrespect Brayden, Jaidynn, Kaydun, Aidan, and poor little MycKinnleigh like that.'
b'I was coming out of the kitchen with hands full of hot plates when a little sex trophy comes around the corner at a thousand miles an hour. I planted my feet and let him run right into me. '
b'Good on you. I have a full circle story here you reminded me about.  \n\nSo I\xe2\x80\x99m filling in at this dive bar I used to work at years ago.  This guy gets super hammered and eventually is telling me he\xe2\x80\x99s going home. (He\xe2\x80\x99s in his late 40s early 50s).  I ask if he wants a cab and he tells me no, he\xe2\x80\x99s going to drive. I tell him no the fuck he\xe2\x80\x99s not while I\xe2\x80\x99m behind the bar. He eventually agrees since he tells me he only lives a few blocks away. \n\nI go to help other people and notice he\xe2\x80\x99s leaving. You can park on the street at this bar and he his truck happened to be close enough that when I looked out the front door I could see like 5 ft of the front of his truck. \n\nAll of a sudden I notice the front lights on the truck turn on so I run out and open his door, he\xe2\x80\x99s mumbling that he\xe2\x80\x99s fine, but fuck that noise.  He puts up a struggle but I literally drag him out of the truck, turn it off, lock it up, and keep the keys. Words were exchanged and he stumbled off.\n\nI leave the keys at the bar with a note so they know who they belong to. About a year goes by and I\xe2\x80\x99m a customer at the bar visiting a friend.  Like I said I guest bartend MAYBE twice a year, so I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the regulars anymore. I\xe2\x80\x99m talking it up with this guy and we somehow get to him talking about that night. He tells me about the time he was in this bar and got dragged out of his truck and how the next day he knew how in the wrong he was when he picked up his keys and was told the story. Said he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t tried since. I told him I was that guy and we shook hands and gave me the most serious thank you I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever gotten.\n\n\nEdit: silver? I can\xe2\x80\x99t feed my future kid who has Christmas cancer silver you selfish wanker! . . . But thank you non the less'
b'Yeah you definitely did the right thing. Whether or not he\xe2\x80\x99s your boss, reporting him helps preventing someone from getting hurt'
b"If someone tips you money, it then belongs to you so didn't he basically just steal money from an employee? And no one cared to stop him?"
b'Sounds like the shitty ass bitch ass c u next Tuesday of an owner I had when I worked at a Greene turtle (sorry, still kind of bitter of her treatment of me and everyone else)...this makes me feel good because I never got to get my revenge/justice. And thank you especially for potentially saving lives in the process.'
b'Honestly, this could saved his life. You set the title up against yourself,   It you BY FAR, did the best thing you could\xe2\x80\x99ve done. This will eventually get him and in the wrong way(killing himself or someone else) and I found out via the police (luckily) but it could have been much worse. Let him learn his lesson . '
b"I generally mind my own business & never call the cops unless someone is doing something illegal that affects me or my family. In other words, my mama didn't raise no snitch. Guy down the street has a meth lab? That's his business. I see someone stealing from the store? Not my problem. However, I *always* call the police on drunk drivers. I've known too many people hurt/killed by drunk drivers & the selfish bastards have absolutely no business behind the wheel. A local doctor likes to say I'm the reason he had a DUI--nope, that's on him. He chose to get behind the wheel after I repeatedly asked him not to & after being warned that I would call 911 on him. He didn't listen. "
b"I got lucky in my schedule and got the lunch shift, but i have no doubt i'll be there all night. :')"
b'Some years back I worked in a high end steak house in a large US city (~$120 ppa). The front half of the dining room normally had six four tops and three large rounds. For valentines, these were moved out and replace with THIRTY two top rounds. One year, one of the other senior servers and I ended up teaming a 13 table section that included a large 12-14 top rectangular table in the middle of the dining room, three four to six person banquettes, and a smattering of these little deuces. For comparison, our normal section size was three tables, so 13 was quite a stretch. That was one of the nights I still can\xe2\x80\x99t believe I didn\xe2\x80\x99t full on snap at someone, it was an absolute shit show. Good luck tonight, and remember the service will end. Eventually. '
b'In for the closing togo shift. Should be fine. We tend to over staff on days like this. Good luck to all of you. '
b'We have all the worst servers on tonight because the manager making the schedule totally forgot its Valentine\xe2\x80\x99s Day. I\xe2\x80\x99m off and I can\xe2\x80\x99t wait to hear how it goes down. \n\n(And I\xe2\x80\x99m not totally shitting on my coworkers, it\xe2\x80\x99s not their fault our managers don\xe2\x80\x99t make sure they\xe2\x80\x99re trained and there\xe2\x80\x99s no repercussions for coming in drunk/high/late even though we\xe2\x80\x99re a well-renowned fine dining restaurant.) '
b'So nervous because I just transitioned from serving to managing and tonight is my first solo shift!'
b"Even if it was true that you rang the order in wrong...they still didn't pay for the second sandwich. Like the manager could have decided to give them another for free but they didn't have to make such a big deal about you having made a mistake in order to do so"
b'not difficult but this was the only time where a table actually made me cry; I work in a Japanese restaurant where customers have to fill out order sheets, similar to those AYCE sushi restaurants; this table of middle-aged women made me cry because they couldn\'t even be arsed to lift their lazy fingers to fill out the order sheet themselves and yelled "it\'s YOUR job to fill out the order sheet FOR us" when I tried to explain that customers are the ones who are supposed to fill them out and that\'s the way it has always been--no, that\'s not how it works you dumbasses, the order sheets are for YOU to fill out, it\'s why we have order sheets and a pencil on EVERY TABLE for customers to fill out themselves. They also were like "I can\'t believe you\'re making us STUDY when we\'re just here to eat" like WTF you bitches it\'s not that hard to find what you want on the order sheet and then write down the quantity you want. They said they were never coming back which was PERFECTLY fine with me. '
b"Jeez, was it enough to cover your tip out? Just remember that most people treat other like shit because somebody else is doing the same thing to them. Don't let this bitchass ruin the day for you! Just talk mad shit about her with your fellow servers! I'm pretty sure you know that helps a lot! "
b"One time a manager of mine pulled me into the walk-in and told me I was one of the greatest servers he's seen in his career and I'm better than snide, rude customers who make up shit for free food. That was 7 years ago and it still gives me confidence.\n\n&#x200B;"
b"It's amazing what some one can say to you and turn your whole mood around, That's why I always try to be nice, always try to give respect when it's due."
b'I\xe2\x80\x99m going to need as much help as I can get. Today is my first training shift at a new place, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I can prepare myself enough. '
b'I felt myself starting to tear up just reading this. Goddamn I\xe2\x80\x99m sensitive.\n\nYou\xe2\x80\x99re a good person. The world would be a better place if we\xe2\x80\x99d all give each other just a little support.'
b'Not gonna lie I was expecting something very aggravating but this was a nice change of speed for this sub. I hope you\xe2\x80\x99re feeling better now and thanks for making my morning today! '
b'Making the world a better place. One random act of kindness at a time.'
b"There's constant examples of how terrible people are but there's plenty of occasions when they shine too. I think the heart warning moments have a greater impact on me.  Maybe because I choose for it to be that way.  When a coincidental moment like this occurs thnn it's just universal magic bringing us together. I'm glad this happened to you. \n\nThank you for sharing and I hope you feel better. "
b'You know, most of the stories of this sub test my faith in humanity with customers who are either absent minded, willfully wrathful, or a combination of the two. But once in a while there are these ones that actually give me some faith.\n\n For what it is worth OP I hope you have a good day tomorrow despite the shit you are going through.'
b'Thought she was going to yell at you for a second there... really happy with the outcome :) hope things get better for the both of you! '
b'Sometimes the best part of this job is being able to be there  for someone in need like you were.  Thank you for helping this sister get through her evening.  '
b"I'm gonna go listen to Lean On Me and cry for a little bit."
b'Hope you feel better. '
b'Sometimes people like that are placed in your life to get a better understanding of what you\xe2\x80\x99re going through, and vice versa. I\xe2\x80\x99m glad y\xe2\x80\x99all both experienced each other in your times of need. '
b'You\xe2\x80\x99re a good person, and the world would be much better off if we could be more open with each other. '
b'Your background paragraph was word for word what I was going through about two years ago. It was a VERY tough time for me and I\xe2\x80\x99m glad you found someone to share the pain with, even for a moment.\n\nI\xe2\x80\x99m in a much better place now and you will be also, in time. Until then, be strong and know that many in this world care about you, even some you have never met.'
b'Looks like the banquets manager gets to pick out a brand new set of china, courtesy of this wedding party! Total scum. I work at a hotel and this would have been shut down so quick. Where were the managers and security?'
b'I had to read it twice ... A real head scratcher.'
b'I\'ve had similar situations back when I was a ride operator at a theme park.\n\nYou just go home, shower, post the story online, wonder to yourself "did this actually happen?" for years to come. '
b"I really enjoyed this one.  Keep us posted if there's any more twists down the road!"
b'So did you get railed in the ass last night bro? lmao'
b"It is always iffy to use a new offer job as a negotiation tool in asking for a raise. It puts employers on the defensive a lot of the time. I wouldn't mention the new job, but I would ask for a raise and see where you land with that. At the end of the day, business is business. If they don't offer you a comparable amount and, in turn,  you want to leave your current job because of these money related reasons, no reasonable person could blame you."
b'I\xe2\x80\x99ve left a restaurant to go to another for more money. Honestly you probably won\xe2\x80\x99t get the raise so I would be prepared to quit. Do it properly if you really like your managers and coworkers. Just say \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve loved my time working here and appreciate the knowledge and experience I\xe2\x80\x99ve gained. It\xe2\x80\x99s time for me to move on (you can mention to a different restaurant if you like, but you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to) and do what\xe2\x80\x99s best for me and my future.\xe2\x80\x9d You have to do what\xe2\x80\x99s best for you and you don\xe2\x80\x99t owe them any more information than that. Put in your two weeks and move on. '
b'I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how they do it at the place you work or state you live in, but when I was a server there was a base hourly wage for servers ($2.38 at the time) and it was the same everywhere. The only way you could make more money was with better tips, and that meant high volume or expensive menu. And the base wage usually got swallowed by taxes anyway and I\xe2\x80\x99d get biweekly paychecks for like $7.50 lol\n\n'
b'It really depends on how valuable you are at your current job. Are you a lead server? Part MOD? One of the more reliable ones who gets good comments? If so,  there\xe2\x80\x99s a possibility that they\xe2\x80\x99d want to retain you. F&B jobs have such high turnover rates that it\xe2\x80\x99s refreshing to be able to keep really good quality employees for an extended time period. I\xe2\x80\x99d go to the manager in charge of this kind of thing and let them know that you were offered a job elsewhere and that although you like your job here, you are likely going to take it because it makes better money. That opens the door for them to make a counter offer, if any. However I\xe2\x80\x99m also curious if the hourly pay is any different. If it\xe2\x80\x99s solely tips that you are assuming will be higher, there might not be much your current place would be willing to do. If it\xe2\x80\x99s the hourly wage that\xe2\x80\x99s higher, you\xe2\x80\x99ve got a better chance of your current place matching that or at least offering something beneficial in order to retain you. You don\xe2\x80\x99t lose anything from asking, though!'
b'Reminds me of the scene in the Sesame Street movie "Follow that Bird" where they go to a grouch diner (the "Don\'t Drop Inn") and Maria orders a "tossed salad."'
b'I never liked Subway, now I will never go there. Last time I had one of their sandwiches was 5 yrs ago? Keeping it that way.'
b'This would format a lot better if you took out the indents at the beginning of each paragraph. '
b"Parents who let their kids runaround while they drink are just complete assholes.  I have had parents stay hours drinking while their kids either sit board, or terrorize the place.  I truly don't understand the mind set.  "
b'Prepare yourself for Douche bag dudes that only go out once a year on Valentine\xe2\x80\x99s Day trying to impress a chick. These types of dudes are usually super fun to be around'
b"You will do fine. Or as fine as v-day allows.\n\nWon't lie, v-day is utter crap. One table at a time. One guest at a time. But we will all get through it.\n\nSending preemptive internet hugs to you for after your shift tomorrow."
b'I take all the luck I can get. And then run for my life.'
b"Hey, it's all gonna be okay! Imo one of the best things about working in service is that, generally, each day is sort of independent from the last. You can go home with the full knowledge that tomorrow is a new day and forget about your mistakes. I know anxiety sucks but honestly, none of what you did was all that bad.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHope things start going better for you soon! Keep your chin up <3 "
b"The more I read this, the entitled parents sub,and the choosy beggars sub, I realllly don't understand how anyone thinks they can demand another person's property. Like yeah I'll give you my pins if you give me your iphone x.."
b"I love that you're working at a *German* restaurant and wear *pieces of flair.* I'd tip extra just based on that."
b'This attitude of \xe2\x80\x9cYou have something, I want it, give it to me or else you\xe2\x80\x99re being selfish\xe2\x80\x9d angers me to the point of Mrs. White in Clue. \n\nI have this item because of hard work, and I in no way owe it to some narcissistic entitled CB, child or otherwise. My not sharing does not make me selfish, it makes you lazy and cheap. '
b'I used to work at a now defunct national chain that required their servers to wear flair. We could earn special pieces by hitting certain achievements. I had one in particular for volunteering during the cleanup after a local disaster. The company made those to recognize is who did special fundraising and community projects. \n\nOne night, a lady became irate that I would not give her my pin. I told her I earned it by doing volunteer work and I did not want to part with it. A very similar situation happened, with her becoming irate and demanding to see a manager. Same result, the answer was still no. She left without getting her food or paying for it. \n'
b'Less intense, but this happens to me every year. I work at a Cajun restaurant that throws a big party for Fat Tuesday. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been working there for almost 6 years now and have a collection of beads that guests have brought me from New Orleans that I wear for the event. I\xe2\x80\x99ll bring hundreds of beads to pass out, and the restaurant itself purchases thousands for everyone. Inevitably we run out and drunk guests start demanding I give away what I\xe2\x80\x99m wearing. I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind giving them away, they\xe2\x80\x99re pieces of plastic, but I do not like being told I HAVE too because some drunk asshole wants it. It\xe2\x80\x99s my property, fuck off. '
b'You directed her to a site where she could buy the pin but she wanted yours. Would have interesting to then offer to sell them to her for $200. You would then replace them at the site you know of.\n\nMy guess is she would have balked at the price whereupon you could have called her on being selfish and disappointing her child.  Wonder if turning the tables like that would have altered her ideas about her son being indulged. '
b'I worked in a theme park and had similar happen to me over a How To Train Your Dragon pin. It was a really cool design, a Night Fury emblem on a red background, and was gifted by a regular guest when I mentioned that I really liked the movies. This kid asked nicely if he could have, i said \xe2\x80\x9csorry sweetie, but I really like this one.\xe2\x80\x9d He nodded his head and ran off, but then dad came over the hurl abuse about how \xe2\x80\x9che needed it for his collection\xe2\x80\x9d. Needless to say, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t back down. Amazing how salty people get really.'
b"Surprised you didn't get a write up and have to end up leaving your pins at home"
b"Hi fellow pin collector! Are you in r/pins and r/enamelpins too?  \n\n[Here's my collection](http://imgur.com/hOQiWS5), as of the 1st of the year. I have a few more now, and there are 3 missing, really special ones I haven't figured out what to do with them yet.\n\nWhen I was serving, I kept them pinned to my collar. Sometimes a lanyard but that got in the way. The apron though I could never pull off. They'd pop off randomly and I spent too much time looking for them, lol."
b"I wonder if they just assumed it was like Disneyland and that you can trade pins with staff except they missed out on the part where you have to trade and don't just demand free ones. "
b'As someone who sometimes collects pin this pisses me off to no end. I have some that are Kickstarter exclusives'
b'I\'ve actually had a few experinces like this myself. One of them is when I was at Knott\'s Berry Farm with my little sister and cousins. \n\nWe were at those carnival game booths and my sister immediately fell in love with a jumbo sized fluffy pony from \'Despicable Me\'. She asked me to try to win the game to get it for her and I was like "sure". After spending around $20 at this booth, I finally knock down all the cans and am asked to pick a prize. I, of course, ask for the fluffy pony. Now, I have pretty bad anxiety and tend to get panic attacks when confronted. After recieving the fluffy pony, this older guy walks up to me and demands I give him the pony for his 7 or 8 year old daughter and that I was "*too old for toys*". I stay quiet and start to feel like im going to cry. I guess my silence meant it was okay to just take the oversized toy from me and he begins to walk away. Thankfully the game attendant stood up for me and had the man give it back and told him that a surely a big guy like him can knock down a few cans. \n\nI dont know if he ended up winning a pony too but the entitlement of this guy caused me to have a full on shacky ugly cry in the middle of a crowded amusmement park. At least my sister liked the pony and still has it in her room 6 years later.'
b"Damn this pisses me off. The child shouldn't have been allowed to go into the kitchen to begin with. You could have had something hot in your hands, and spilled it all over the kid, especially if this was later in the morning, as I'm suspecting (please correct me if I'm wrong)."
b"This is horrifying on so many levels! I am an avid pin collector myself so I understand the love of sharing pictures. I'd be devastated if I discovered someone trying to steal mine! Imagine if he succeeded- trying to pry them away from the family would be a whole nother level of hell to go through!"
b'Next time someone demands your pin, offer to sell it but name a crazy price you say it\xe2\x80\x99s worth \xe2\x80\x94 $5000. '
b'Those pins better be made out if fucking precious gems for a parent to be okay with their kid doing this shit. Even then, fucks sake. Personal space to begin with, manners, behaving, acting civil.. I fear for that boy and his future.'
b"Wow I wear pins on my lanyard at work so I get it but I also work in collections so I'd offer $50 per pin ($100 for the pin swap one)"
b'I hate parents like this. They do all other parents such a disservice, I like kids a lot but sometimes you look at a kid\'s parents and think "yikes, they\'re going to turn out just like that." It bums me out.\n\nI\'m glad your manager wasn\'t a tool. Please keep being awesome with your pins. '
b"That kind of behavior is inexcusable from both parents and child. Have an upvote since I don't have much else to give you. Hope the rest of your week goes better!"
b'You got some penny arcade pins? They got some great gaming pins. I dont dare wear pins at work because of scratches and damage to them. Ill wear a nice one out once in a while on a zip up but i dont let people touch em.\nSounds like a nightmare in every way'
b'The entitlement in this woman. Love your collection, by the way. I also collect pins and have a purse/bag covered in some of my favourites. Usually I love when people ask about them, especially kids (I even tend to avoid ones with profanity or anything because I know kids can be so fascinated) But I also had a couple kids almost follow me home one day because they asked me to give them a button and couldn\xe2\x80\x99t accept a simple \xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x9d. \n\nAlso, \xe2\x80\x9cvideo games are for boys, anyway\xe2\x80\x9d? Are you for real lady? What was she expecting: \xe2\x80\x9cWow, must\xe2\x80\x99ve bought the wrong ones then! Here you go!\xe2\x80\x9d'
b"Why do YOU need Wonder Woman pins? \nYou're not old enough to know who Wonder Woman is! \nYou're just jumping on the Justice League movies bandwagon. \nWhich is for kids. \nYou're too old for Wonder Woman!\n\nBest you just give them to me!\n\n/s"
b"Where can I get doodlebob? I'll PM you my address if you wanna give it to me since I've been good all year"
b'I would have turned the child over to my manager and confronted the parents to let them know he\xe2\x80\x99s being held until a verified legal guardian presents us with paperwork proving you\xe2\x80\x99re responsible for him.\n\nYou teach your child assault and stealing is okay, I teach you what the system looks like. Because by sending him into an employee area, you made me legally culpable for his safety.'
b'I have a custom pin that\'s Cuzco from The Emporer\'s New Groove saying "No Touchy" that I used to wear when I worked at TGIChilibees. That feels like it would be appropriate for you...'
b'Gawd, I hate people like that....they should not be allowed to procreate....ever.'
b'Where do you get your pins? Do you buy them online, is there a certain store you can go to?'
b"I feel bad for this kid. He's never going to learn what the word no means. I feel even more sorry for his future teachers, friends, friends' parents, and especially any romantic interests he might have."
b'So if he liked your earrings you should just give them to him.  SMH.  Fuck this generation.'
b"The poor kid doesn't have the fault, sad to see that mother being a fucking asshole, also poor dad"
b'Why would you offer to pay for their food? Food is cheap as hell. Even if you get 50% off at work the restaurant is still making money off you. Never offer to pay for mistakes ever.'
b"I'm envious of the Toothless pin. So are you going to give it to me or what?!?"
b'They were probably in a play together and decided to go out in character.'
b"Aw! That turned out better than expected! We have a husband and wife couple who come in who are really picky, but they're nice about it. They don't tip more than average, BUT they kind of look out for us. They gave me $100 for Christmas one year, and paid me another $100 to help out at their Thanksgiving (and I also got a great Thanksgiving dinner). There's another family whose kids have all kinds of allergies, and they're also super-nice. They've loaned me books, and I'm going to a concert with the mom in April. "
b'A couple of years ago my wife had to be hospitalized for a couple of months. She was having a hard time emotionally, and I was there late every night trying to help her hold it together. \n\nI went into the breakfast/lunch place where we were regulars and sat at the counter.  I must have looked like death, because the counter staff asked what was wrong, and I told them.  And that place just folded up around me like a big blanket after that -- so much support, so many inquiries about my wife and conversations.  They really helped.\n\nWhen she was out of hospital, we went over there right away together, and it was like homecoming.  Great people.'
b'When I worked at a pizza place we had a lady who ordered one extra cheese pizza (I did the math) 4.8 times a week for take out (she was very very frugal and chose that order because it was cheapest). I looked and Mrs. G had been ordering like that for four years. She was always a lovely woman to interact with. I knew all about her son (he was in high school working part time to pay for hot air ballon piloting classes) and her dogs (elderly yorkies with leg issues) and her love of local coffee shops. \n\nThen we went a week with no orders. I fretted about her and her family. I stressed about how ethical it was to use her order history to check if she was alright. I had decided (two weeks after her last order) that I was gonna call her up when I finished rush. Make sure she and her family were ok. \n\nBut she called me first and ordered the usually. Now this woman was like Grace from Grace and Frankie. Always looked like she\xe2\x80\x99d just been from a salon blowout with a professional makeup artist. She walked in wearing sweats and no make up. Her husband had a heart attack. Then blockages. Then bypass surgery. Then another bypass surgery. Then a stroke. She hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been for pizza cause her and the son had been living at the hospital. Husband was finally stable enough she felt ok leaving for a bit. Taking her son home and getting pizza. \n\nSo I comp the pizza and hand her a handful of free pizza cards. I tell her that she should place her orders through a manager but we\xe2\x80\x99ll take care of delivery and tip. She doesn\xe2\x80\x99t need to worry about picking up food during this trying time. We\xe2\x80\x99ll bring it to her. Maybe something familiar will make things a little easier. Her first delivery came with a get well soon card signed by most of the store. \n\nHer husband got released a month later and we put a note on her file that she should have delivery fees waived and receive carry out prices for the next six months. \n\nIn case you think Einstein stood up and clapped...this woman was spending almost $2,000 a year on our pizza and had been for four years. She was the definition of a life long, valued customer. '
b"I'm curious, what are the specifications?\n\nI've had a severe eating disorder for around 5-6 years now.\n\nFor me, I hate restaurants. Everything is too caloric, not to mention too expensive, and I cant trust what all was put in the food. I mean, if I plan to purge the food tho, that's a different story.\n\nI used to work at a Mexican grill, so I know the recipes there inside and out, so that is the only place I can go and then I usually order foods that are safe for me: lettuce, pico de gallo, enchilada sauce, a side of chicken. I know exactly what goes into these things and I count them as safe foods."
b'Ive never had an eating disorder, but i\xe2\x80\x99ve struggled from a variety of other mental health problems. Your kindness and willingness to help oit like that despite it being extra work means more than you could ever imagine to them. Thanks for being a good person.'
b'Sounds like ARFID. (Avoidant Restrictive Food Intake Disorder).  It\xe2\x80\x99s in the diagnostic manual for mental disorders (DSM).  My 5yr old son has been diagnosed with it.  Recovery is a hard road, but there is treatment available, and we have made a small amount of progress in the last year or so.  Good on you for being understanding, so many people think it\xe2\x80\x99s just \xe2\x80\x98fussy\xe2\x80\x99 eating.'
b"I don't understand people like this (the guest). If she calmly and politely explained her situation from the beginning there would likely never be the need to ask for a manager. The cooks will take extra care, the FOH will happily doubly check the order. If it's just some picky asshat staff are less likely to double or triple check things. Obviously, ideally you should be striving to deliver each order as requested but there's a limit to how many mods are reasonable before it's just annoying. Unless there's a legit reason like a severe dietary restriction. "
b'Money really does ruin people. Sorry she was ruined by it. You\xe2\x80\x99re wealthier than her because you\xe2\x80\x99re working for it and she has it all handed to her on a silver platter'
b"I worked somewhere with the exact same situation regarding tip out and taxes. I ended up going to 3 different tax preparers before I found one who could grasp the concept of me giving away my income without proof. They ended up simply adjusting my income, claiming that it was overstated on my W2. I've since learned that I can easily do the same thing myself using Turbotax. It sucks and technically you need to keep a nightly record of who you tip out (irs.gov has forms you can print out) at a poorly run establishment such as ours. Glad you're looking for other work."
b'At least your manager said they\xe2\x80\x99d give her a talking to so you\xe2\x80\x99ve got some back up!'
b'One time I had an employee come in and tip 18% after their 20% discount. Comes in the next day talking about what a good tip he gave me. Sure, buddy. Wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to start a stupid argument over that lol'
b'That is so beyond the pale, I\xe2\x80\x99m royally pissed on your behalf. I tip the hell out of the servers at any place I eat at, usually 25-30% and if I really liked the server, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tip up to 50% because I know full well how it is. I tip a minimum of 50% if I eat where I work. And I don\xe2\x80\x99t require my friends to tip that much of course, but I make sure they all know what the industry standard is if they have never worked in service. My feet and back hurt from just reading this. That level of exhaustion is so awful. I hope you get some rest, and please update us on the situation. I hope the bitch gets fired. '
b"Can't you add gratuity to large tables? We usually do that to younger people even if they end up splitting the check. Especially if they're messed up ill make sure I get my cut after dealing with that and I had to learn that the hard way. \n\nWhy does reading these on my day off stress me out so much? \n\n"
b'Time to get as many friends as possible together to run that server ragged and no tip her......'
b'Any time I\xe2\x80\x99ve had to cook or serve to an employee off shift they\xe2\x80\x99ve been nothing but amazing and usually tip like 100%. I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry that this happened. '
b"I really feel for you, that's so low of them. Please update us on the outcome, I really hope it's satisfying enough for you (and all of us onlookers!)\n\nHonestly it sounds like you work insanely hard, and you deserve better than to be treated that way. I absolutely would've cried.\n\n*Work, not works"
b'The other employee that showed her ass can go get fucked.\n\nShe knows the limits, and the difficulty of everything, and still did what she did. Screw her with a porcupine up her ass and to the left.'
b"This is employees should always wait in their friends and family. Just in case you have rude relatives. And also probably shouldn't go to your place of work while doing drugs."
b'Owner where I help gets pissed if any employees come in and gets drunk, etc.  I could not imagine going into my place of employment high and then being an ass.\n\nOn a side note,  I use to work with this girl that worked most nights, but every once in awhile would come in with a couple friends.  We got pretty close and I knew she had a tough go of it & always got stuck picking up the tab for her friends.  I never accepted a tip from her.'
b'Perhaps they didn\xe2\x80\x99t recognize her but that seems far fetched. Assuming they did recognize her, however, it is a clear error on the part of the server to not give the girl her discount. And as I\xe2\x80\x99ve stated, it is as wrong as wrong to not tip. She should\xe2\x80\x99ve tipped at least 30+ percent. Downvote me if you like but you know I\xe2\x80\x99m right. Own it. '
b'MY BIGGEST PET PEEVE WHEN PEOPLE WHO WORK AT A PLACE DO THAT. \n\nOur employees get 50% off no matter when they come in so they are told they have to tip at least 20% off the pre discounted check and there\xe2\x80\x99s this girl who works in the kitchen who comes in multiple times to eat who just stiffs the check altogether or the last time she came in she tipped like 10% off of the discounted check. It makes me mad. It\xe2\x80\x99s already frustrating when customers do that but man you work here you know everyone here and you know we survive off tips. That\xe2\x80\x99s just plain ignorant '
b'Every time I read this I go into a first-scene-of-pulp-fiction-Raquel rant in my head about tipping\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s fucking ridiculous that whether or not you are able to pay the bills is reliant on people tipping you. And it also sucks for consumers as the price on the menu is hardly even representative of the price of your meal now'
b'"oh, I\'m sorry. I\'ll pass out from lack of oxygen next time and drop the food all over the place.*\n\nIdiot'
b'I would have returned with the new plate with my cheeks all puffed out, mouth tightly sealed, to dramatically show me holding my breath as I walk to them. Then after setting it down I would halfway turn and super dramatically release my breath and gasp for air loudly. While still partially \xe2\x80\x9ccatching my breath,\xe2\x80\x9d ask if there is anything else I can get for him. I\xe2\x80\x99m petty though.'
b'I see this mentality a lot, even in family members who have done service work before and should understand. Like instead of bussing their own table at a cafe where it\xe2\x80\x99s the norm, they\xe2\x80\x99ll say, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, it\xe2\x80\x99s their job to clean this up.\xe2\x80\x9d Also in retail stores, leaving clothes all over the dressing room. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s their job!\xe2\x80\x9d I guess they\xe2\x80\x99ve forgotten what it was like and/or think of themselves as above it now. '
b'The snapping really irritates me. When I served I would purposely ignore that kind of behavior, or those who shook their glass at me. If you need something, be a human and use your words to ask nicely. '
b"Parents don't care in a restaurant.  I had a table this week, fucking destroy the table.  It was 2 couples (4 adults) and their 4 small kids.  I'll say all under 4.  There wasn't a dry surface on the table.  It was 100% covered in smears, caked on food, sauces, bit of food, etc.  I didn't prebus as I figured they can fester in their mess.  Plus, half the party was eating off the table, so what is there to prebus?\n\n\nOnce they left, I put on gloves, and all the other tables in the area watched my attempt to clean it. First was removing things I wouldn't be throwing away onto one tray, and a coworker took that back.  Then with two hands, I physically scooped up handfuls of food onto the second tray, along with countless balled up napkins, multiple used wetnaps, coloring sheets, broken crayons, and juice boxes.  Then was the 5-6 pieces of silverware under the table, plus the spilled drink no one told me about, and even more food....a lot more food.  For the surface, I got a cup of hot tea water and purposely spilled it all over the table to loosen things up.  I then used the back, flat side of a knife as a scrapper to go around the table as if I'm scraping ice from a windshield.  That liquid sludge was pushed onto a small tray.  Some of the chairs needed the same service.  The floor was swept, hot water spilled, hit with the broom again to break things up, and then tried with towels.\n\n\n...not worth the $10 extra over 20% they left.  I only wish I could have taken cell phone pictures, and posted them on the company FB page, calling out the parents by name."
b'"Oh. I thought you were better than that. My mistake."\n'
b'Is that last sentence a question?'
b'I work in a pretty affluent neighborhood in Los Angeles, we have at least three separate customers who come in almost  daily to "try" our soups, I\'m not sure I\'ve ever seen them buy any.'
b'Sometimes you find out the hard way  \n\n\nA regular customer comes into the store, normally it is her and her sister, but today is just her. Which isn\'t that weird. I casually remark "Oh only one drink today? not going to take one back for your sister"  \n\n\n"I just came from her funeral, I\'m not having a good day, please just give me my drink"  \n\n\nOh.'
b'This has happened to me. I\xe2\x80\x99ve had several regulars over the years that would suddenly stop coming in. \n\nOnce, I recognized a friend of one of my regular little old ladies, as they sometimes came in together. I inquired after her and discovered she\xe2\x80\x99d had a stroke and was hospitalized for weeks. \n\nI passed a long my well wishes, and several months later she came in with her daughter. She was now in a wheelchair and had trouble speaking ,as her left side was pretty badly affected. She seemed very happy to see me, and her daughter told me she had been asking to come back to us ever since she got home from the hospital. Her daughter (who came to town to be with her during her recovery) then told me she positively lit up when her friend passed along my love while she was in hospital. \n\nI gave her a big hug and it was all I could do to not start bawling right there. It was just a polite message if asked to pass along, and to think her regular waitress could impact her life so much and make her happy was thrilling. And pretty sad. A simple act of kindness really can mean the world to someone. You just never know. '
b"If you have a customer that comes in all the time, is nice, not demanding, older and just talks to you a little more than necessary, keep in mind something... they are lonely.  If they live alone, family might or might not live in town, and are busy.  Their friends may be in the same shape, and it may be difficult to get out.  They just want to feel like they still matter somewhere.  find out a name, get a phone number, and if they don't come in, check on them.  It's called being a human being and have respect for your elders, and caring. I always treated people like I would want to be treated.  Besides, you might learn it makes a difference in your life as well as theirs.  I had a lady who I did her hair in the same style for years, came across as the gruff woman that was as tough as a boot, when in reality, she was so isolated she just needed a friend.  Her attitude changed, towards everyone when I just gave her a call one evening and talked to her.  I got to where I called her once a week, just to check on her, for the next ten years. She had a stroke, i went to the hospital and later the house and did her hair.  When she passed away, her family thanked me for being her friend.  I learned a lot from her."
b'LEARN HER NAME\nI used to work at a restaurant with two of my cousins that had about five older men that had no families that would come in everyday sometimes multiple times a day. The oldest of them was Art. Art has no kids and no spouse. He\'s a business man that travels to Chicago regularly for business meetings and is obsessed with sports. He befriended everyone that worked at our store and even made such good friends with one of our bartender gals that she would attend every local Cubs or Bulls game with him. The religiously planned when they would pick up their tickets; He had tickets for life for the Cubs. And one week he said "I\'m going to Chi for a week, when I get back on Saturday we\'ll go get our tickets." Saturday rolls around and he didn\'t show to pick up the tickets. Everyone tried calling him to no avail. So everyone went into Private investigator mode and found his business associates in Chicago. Call them and it turns out he didn\'t even show for his business meeting. Find his house and his car was dusty with leaves on it. Go to his door and he had several fliers on it. He\'s a smart old guy so he had a light timer so that when he would go out of town it would appear that he was home and he wouldn\'t get robbed. Go to the landlord and they said because it appeared he was home, he couldn\'t enter his home. Call the police and get them to agree to a Well check. Turns out he had died and was already decomposing. And the only people that noticed were the staff at the restaurant he frequented. His service was hosted at the restaurant and his favorite drink was served the whole time.'
b'I\xe2\x80\x99m sure she\xe2\x80\x99s lonely. The time you take out of your shift to listen to her probably means a lot! She might not get out very much and this is an opportunity for socialization for her. You should definitely ask her name to get on a first name basis!'
b'At my restaurant, the hosts check the obituaries daily as 90% of our customers are over 85.'
b"Worked at a brewery last year, had a lady come in every day for her glass of wine with her dog. Her dog was so noisy and loud, other guests hated him. She didn't care. The brewery named a beer after her dog."
b'I usually just break away from telling to excuse me for a moment. Or pretending to look at my other table like I need to go, this acting disinterested in a more polite way so they excuse me or stop talking so I excuse myself lol'
b'Yeah, I feel you. We once had a regular, Nick that would come it every day for lunch and one day he stopped coming out of the blue. My asshole boss (a story for another time) had to go to his house and check on him. Turns out, Nick got in a pretty bad car accident and was bed bound...Fast forward to a year later, he celebrated his birthday at the restaurant and booked half of the space for his party! The next day we get a call from his sister letting us know that he had passed away that same day. At least, Nick died with a happy stomach. RIP Nick!!'
b">Good luck dealing with other tables when she comes in because you absolutely cannot break away.\n\nThis is the sign of a poor server.  A server who knows what he's doing can break away from any table at any time."
b'Even as a server I will never tell anyone to tip for awful service. If the server is rude, lazy or outright bad I understand some people may not choose to tip, but when you get good service and you choose to not tip based on a small inconvenience that can be resolved with communicating to a server they deserve compensation for time and effort put into a table. Just other day I had a table split a check and I made a mistake splitting an appetizer instead of appetizer being on only one ticket, the table wrote a note on bottom of both tickets and choose not to tip off a mistake that could of been fixed in seconds.  '
b'For Jesus Christ\xe2\x80\x99s sakes.  I keep saying in this sub, I\xe2\x80\x99m from the uk, in my 30s and my parents never told me tipping was a choice, it was something you naturally did.  Dinner, hairdresser,taxi, delivery driver etc.  It is baffling to me that for many years it was just the done thing and now our generations are being all shitty and angry about \xe2\x80\x98having to tip\xe2\x80\x99.  I fully agree that servers In the US should be paid a fair wage, but I just don\xe2\x80\x99t get why it has become this irritating smug bullshit of \xe2\x80\x98well I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t HAVE to pay you\xe2\x80\x99. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure there have been plenty of people over the last 50/60 years who have stiffed servers but it seems this annoying new trend of smugness and lack of empathy for others.  Just fucks me off, why is it so fucking hard to be nice?!'
b"They banned me for my comment. I really don't think it was out of line, but whatever.\n\n After working on the restaurant biz for 25 years, I can say with a lot of certainty that at least 9 out of 10 guests that claim they don't tip because they 'don't  believe in tipping ' are really just entitled assholes. They are the same type of guests that will look down their noses at service people as if they are inferiors and find any excuse to complain.\n\nI guess being called out for this must have touched a nerve. Oh well. "
b'There\xe2\x80\x99s days like that and days where things are going wrong and people have to wait but are super gracious about it and tip you above average despite it.  The former suck, the latter make up for it.   In a way, nothing beats the days where everything feels like it\xe2\x80\x99s going wrong but you\xe2\x80\x99ve got customers who for whatever reason are shining examples of humanity and help you get through it.   Sorry you had one of the shit days with shit customers :( hope your next shit day is one of the ones with great customers to make up for it.  '
b"I find that I don't have bad days where everything goes wrong, but I definitely have tables that I just can't get anything right with.  Usually my fault not theirs, just seems to be sometimes if something goes wrong, everything else does and I end up looking like a moron.  "
b'Today I set my alarm for 8:45 pm instead of am, so I woke up a half hour late. Then when getting dressed, I found that my zipper on my uniform had broken in the wash last night so I had to exchange it, making me another 15 mins late. Did I mention I woke up with heartburn that never stopped all day, in spite of a Pepcid? My first tip was $2. Then a $7 on $112. Then I got asked to stay for a double (10.5 hrs). It was brutal. I\xe2\x80\x99m so exhausted. But I sold $2650 so do the math, it was worth it. Now I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna sleep for 12 hours. '
b'somebody got off the crazy train at the wrong stop!'
b'Does that transfer across all beverages? \n\nAs a thirsty patron, I tip in the 50-60% range because I know I run the server ragged filling my water glass. '
b"You gave them a salt rim like on a margarita, but put it in the glass. It's not like anyone is going to die.  A bit petty re the girl, did she know he was a cheater?  "
b'He manipulated me for our whole relationship. I hope she finds/ found better. '
b'Might be a better question for r/legaladvice I think'
b"That reminds me of this one day when it snowed. Didn't have any customers for the first couple of hours, and then all hell broke loose. See, the university had shut down, and so had most other restaurants (even Waffle House was closed). Host couldn't make it, and my co-worker was a couple of hours late because the roads were bad. On an average opening shift, my sales are like $500-$700. On this day, my sales were like $1,700 (which is especially much considering we were dead for the first couple of hours). Fortunately, people were pretty understanding - they were just glad we were open at all. Walked out with about $250, which was great, but... I would not want to do that again."
b"On the opposite side of the spectrum: my best friend's boyfriend is highly allergic to shellfish and he never tells the server. He also doesn't carry his epi pen all the time. \n\nWe were once at a place where you build a bowl and they cook it for you and I ended up with shrimp in my bowl that I didn't ask for and I was so worried for him "
b"I once had a lady order a salad but tell me she was allergic to the green iceberg lettuce so make sure to only use the white iceberg lettuce. \n\nI thought I misunderstood so I asked if she was talking about the romaine or spring mix\n\nShe got agitated and told me she needed me to take the green parts of the iceberg lettuce off and only serve her the white parts. While saying this she mimed tearing a leaf in half with her napkin.\n\nThat was like 8 years ago and I still worry about her accidentally getting the wrong part of the same leaf in her food one day. I don't know if she'd survive it"
b'I\'m allergic to shellfish, and as a precaution, I dont eat at tables where they eat it.\nI have to ingest it, so sometimes cross contamination is a real fear.\n\nI\'m very open to my server about this and I make sure to tell them "if the foods gonna be a bit late, that\'s fine, but if you wouldn\'t mind, can I have a glas of water while I wait?".\n\nMy guests are not as picky but if they are, I treat them with the respect they deserve. '
b'My dad is allergic to shellfish, mustard, and eggplant. He has (thankfully) gotten less sensitive as he\'s gotten older, so it\'s not an anaphylactic shock- type of situation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe can\'t ever eat a shrimp scampi, or lobster roll, or oysters - but if he eats french fries that have been in the same fryer as calamari, he\'s fine.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhere it\'s hard is dressings, spice rubs, condiments, etc. Almost ALL of them have mustard seed or mustard powder in them (read some labels next time you\'re buying salad dressing at the grocery store - it\'s shocking and very difficult to find some without "mustard powder" or "mustard seed") - which is why he asks for all of his sauces/dressings on the side, so he can taste a little bit first. He can tell very quickly if he can have it or not, he says his tongue will start tingling in about 5 seconds. He also won\'t ever order anything "blackened" for the same reason.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is when it becomes really important to pay attention to modifiers - if he got a burger and the mayo or aioli was on it, rather than on the side, he\'d have to send it back - but the full anti-cross-contamination procedures aren\'t necessary and he doesn\'t want to put the kitchen through that, so he just asks for thing on the side, or "no mayo", etc. Because as soon as he says the word "allergy" it starts a completely different level of food prep - rightfully so for those with much more severe allergies than his, but he doesn\'t want nor necessitate that level of prep for his order.'
b'My son has a peanut allergy. We\xe2\x80\x99ve only discovered in the past year how bad it is (like, carry two epi-pens and \xe2\x80\x9caccidental skin contact with PB ritz in boys\xe2\x80\x99 locker room = immediate quarter-sized welt [Not following that story any further. I\xe2\x80\x99ll bust him for \xe2\x80\x9clocker room talk\xe2\x80\x9d but \xe2\x80\x9clocker room cracker activities\xe2\x80\x9d are beyond my maternal purview]).\n\nHe\xe2\x80\x99s only just started getting comfortable with informing servers about his allergy. He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like \xe2\x80\x9cthe attention\xe2\x80\x9d but this sub has helped me realize that y\xe2\x80\x99all don\xe2\x80\x99t see it as an inconvenience if it\xe2\x80\x99s legit and I\xe2\x80\x99ve been helping him inform servers politely. We LOVE it when you come out and go over the individual items and discuss your allergy protocol.  It sets us all at ease and we enjoy our meal and time together so much more.\n\nThanks from an allergy mom!'
b"(BOH) I really fucking hate it when people do this. I can always tell if a table has lied because the FOH staff end up getting grief over the wait time of the allergy dish and then I in turn get screamed at for it. I had a table with a pizza that said it was for someone with a gluten, mushroom, lactose and nut allergy yet they couldn't wait 15 minutes for me to make this pizza that could be potentially lethal if made wrong."
b"I generally ask if it's an allergy or intolerance. The one we usually encounter is gluten. As a small street food kitchen I can clean down but it's much harder to guarantee no cross contamination due to the tiny space we work in. We also work off a single grill, I can isolate and cook separately and will do so very happily, but depending on the level of intolerance some will be happy to have something that has been in contact with other items on the grill.\n\nWhen I'm training new staff I explain by asking if they know what a colostomy bag is. If we feed a severe coeliac the wrong or contaminated food it might mean not just a trip to the hospital but also surgery. "
b"I have a few allergies but a whole host of intolerances due to GI damage. I've learned to call all of them allergies otherwise I end up curled up in a ball crying from pain for 12 hours cause the restaurant didn't think my intolerance meant anything.\n\nMeanwhile my wife is horribly deathly allergic to mushrooms and has had so many reactions from cross contamination that we have whittled our safe restaurant list down to like five choices.\n\nInterestingly, one of them is Domino's. Our local Domino's is fucking great at preventing cross contamination, I don't knnow how they do it. "
b"Cut a celiac a little bit of a break.  Celiacs  are NOT allergic to gluten but cannot eat it.  When I was newly diagnosed, I hesitated to say allergy because that isn't technically right.  I was worried someone would think I was lying if I said celiac disease was a gluten allergy.  PS - I do understand the irritation of people lying about allergies.  As a celiac & a pharmacist, I see it all the time and it is a huge time waste."
b'I have allergies, not call an ambulance level, just dairy makes my nose run and wheat makes my tummy hurt.  Fortunately a real allergy, not gluten intolerance which is a very serious autoimmune disease.\n\nBut I hate the people who fake allergies just to be difficult.\n\nSimilar to people with BS service animals, reduces belief in real service animal for blind/deaf/dogs that can anticipate heart attacks, and many others.  Not just an excuse so you can bring your badly disciplined dog to work.\n'
b'I totally agree. However, I have a slightly different side that I wanna share. I\'m sure it applies to very, very few cases, but I want to share it just in case it hasn\'t been thought of. (And in case a random server decided to add a little bit extra of whatever someone is claiming they\'re allergic to because they believe they might be faking it. Not saying you would OP, but some people out here totally would.)\n\nI am severely allergic to dairy/milk, to the point my throat will close up and I die unless I\'m lucky enough to make it with my EpiPen until the ambulance arrives. Luckily, neither of those have happened. If I ask or if the server asks about my allergy, I will let them know that I am deathly allergic to milk and to please be careful. However, if they come back and say that something has milk in it, I might ask how much. Having a very small amount isn\'t going to kill me, not to mention, I enjoy pressing my limits so I know roughly where they lie. So if they tell me there isn\'t much, or if I notice there isn\'t much, I\'ll more than likely still eat it. \n\nThis happened a little bit ago. I asked for a burger with no cheese because I am allergic to milk. They were happy to make it. They then told me the spray they used for the grill had butter. I asked to see the label and noticed that there wasn\'t very much milk in it (mainly an oil based spray.) I was very appreciative of her noticing the spray, I just knew it wasn\'t going to hurt me. So I said it was okay to use it. \n\nI guess what I\'m trying to say is that not all instances of someone saying "Oh it\'s okay, a little bit like that won\'t hurt me," is someone faking an allergy. It could be someone knowing their limits.\n\nThat all being said, I doubt a case like mine is too common. Most people just don\'t like the food so they fake an allergy. My grandmother is like that with mushrooms. And honestly, it pisses me the hell off because it makes people with real allergies slightly less believable. I\'d also understand how you would be pissed to hell and back if someone was faking seeing the long process you have to go through. I\'m sorry you have to deal with that OP.'
b'As someone who has minor (makes my tummy hurt so I avoid it but it\'s not life threatening) allergies, how would you prefer that question answered? Do I just say "I have a minor allergy, so it\'s not a huge deal but prefer to avoid it"? '
b"On the other hand, if I DON'T say it's an allergy and just an intolerance, I get it in my food anyway. Not once in my 23 years of life has a server/chef/whomever actually excluded the ingredient I ask for none of, and it makes me throw up. Every time. I've started saying allergy because people don't take it seriously otherwise, and think they can just throw it in my food. Just because I won't die doesn't mean I can eat it."
b'Okay, so I hate bell peppers. Absolutely loathe them. They ruin everything they touch, as far as I\xe2\x80\x99m concerned. When it seems possible that they might be there under the blanket \xe2\x80\x9cseasonal vegetables\xe2\x80\x9d or whatever, I have to be very clear in my explanation. Because I can tolerate most other varieties of chiles, and I genuinely like jalape\xc3\xb1os for the taste. I have friends who say I should just claim I\xe2\x80\x99m allergic, but I\xe2\x80\x99m not, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to contribute to anyone\xe2\x80\x99s idea that allergies shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be taken seriously. My preferred explanation to waitstaff is \xe2\x80\x9cthey won\xe2\x80\x99t hurt me, I just hate them.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Hahaha, when I was about 18 I had a lady at one of my tables that (during mid-order) said she had an onion allergy, all of her friend were like \xe2\x80\x9cwhat? Rebecca? You don\xe2\x80\x99t have an onion allergy!\xe2\x80\x9d I had other tables to attend to, but they were so caught up in this argument that 18 y/o me didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what to do. So I sat there and listened, eventually just saying \xe2\x80\x9cso no onions on that order?\xe2\x80\x9d And that was the end of it.\n\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t lie about allergies folks. It\xe2\x80\x99s perfectly easy to remove certain things from certain dishes. Some other things are impossible/a pain in the ass for the entire kitchen staff, but having or not having an allergy doesn\xe2\x80\x99t usually change that. \n\nThe main reason the allergy question is asked is to avoid any minor cross contamination that could kill you, it\xe2\x80\x99s something restaurants tend to avoid.'
b'Okay...but this doesn\'t always work.\n\nI have a fairly mild dairy allergy (I get a rash on my face and hands when I eat it consistently). If you ask me at a restaurant, I\'ll tell you I\'m allergic to dairy and can it be made without, because that\'s better for me.\n\nIf you come back and tell me "Hey the sauce has some cream cheese in it" and I haven\'t eaten any dairy for 4+ days, I\'ll pop a Reactin and be good to go. Not all allergies are life-threatening if you\'re exposed to a speck of your allergen. Some are more live-but-suffer-small-consequences. '
b'I carry not one but two \xc3\xa9pi-pens. I\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten to the point where I pull them out of my bag to show servers that I am indeed allergic to shellfish (and intolerant to fish - my line is shellfish may kill me, fish makes me sick but not dead). People (my mother included) who lie about food allergies drive me batty. '
b"Hey.\nI'm lactose intolerant but I can eat some things with lactose in it. For example cheese and butter, as well as ice cream and most cooked food.\n\nIf I inform a server of this, and they come back and say everything's fine but there's normal cheese on the pasta, and I say it's fine, am I an asshole then?\n\nI mean I COULD go on to list every single food I can and cannot eat but I don't think the server would feel like wasting that time.\n\n\nSo yeah, especially in your second example it sounds like something like my story. Think an extra step bro"
b'I flew an airline recently that couldn\'t have given less of a shit about my peanut allergy. Most places I go at least give minimum effort, but all they kept saying was "we can\'t guarantee a safe environment". Motherfucker, you didn\'t even stop selling peanut M&Ms! I was lucky I brought my high grade facemask.'
b"I have this mild itchy mouth reaction to raw pineapple and kiwi (which is interesting to me since the reason why is since the molocoles or something in it is similar to grass, which i am majorly allergic to), but I hate to say its a allergy since I can kinda eat it raw but more then 1 piece starts the reaction and after a few my mouth is a bit burny. I can also eat it cooked since its totally fine to me cooked.\nSo I finally have just figured out to ask if the x and x has raw pineapple/kiwi in it and the waitpeople usually are one step ahead of me and state that yes, it is, but they can leave it out. Which is awesome since I don't want to say its a allergy and have them do all the cross contamination stuff when I'm ok with that, I just need to not have the item directly consumed raw.  I'm also just as polite as I can be with the waitstaff so I like to think that helps."
b'I\'ve not had any trouble with this so far luckily. I found out I\'m lactose intolerant in Sept and will always say "no dairy" even when ordering a BLT that traditionally comes without anyway. Sometimes the servers will go "yep we can make it dairy free" or they\'ll ask if I\'m lactose intolerant so they can take extra care. Finding breakfast at a cafe or just lunch at a bakery can be difficult but it\'s usually ok. \n\nHaving said that, if you invite someone round for hanging out or for a party and then offer them vegan chocolate cake or gluten free stuff, they will love you forever. There\'s one place in my city cbd that sells vegan cookies and slices (looking for vegan baking when out and about is usually easier than dairy free) and I will go out of my way to get there. (Also if you own a restaurant or bakery, add dairy-free stuff to your menu! Substitutions! :D )'
b'On the other end, I\xe2\x80\x99ve basically given up on eating out at Asian restaurants, seafood restaurants, or restaurants that have multiple shellfish items due to having had scary reactions (and one ER visit) via cross-contamination in spite of my informing and asking questions.\n\nI have had servers trying to rush me through my questions, tell me that \xe2\x80\x9cno restaurant can completely prevent cross-contamination,\xe2\x80\x9d or tell me that I should just not order the shellfish dish (if only it were that simple). I love that there has been a huge improvement for allergen sufferers, but my comfort level is pretty low since every restaurant is different, and not every staff member gets it.\n\nI also have to explain items that some may not realize could be contaminated, like fish sauce, or even Worcestershire sauce (I still don\xe2\x80\x99t get why this is listed in articles on foods for me to avoid, but not gonna risk it). When it\xe2\x80\x99s all said and done, I am tired and feel like a weirdo. We went to Paris recently and ate at our AirBnb more than we ate out, partly because the farmers\xe2\x80\x99 markets were so good, and partly because we just didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to deal with the explanations or anxiety. Escargot everywhere!'
b'Serv:  "Any allergies, sensitivities, or dietary restrictions?"  \n\nCust:  "Oh, yes!  Dairy!"  \n\nServ:  (writing)  "Okay... now is that an allergy, a sensitivity, or a dietary restriction?"  \n\nWording MIGHT cut down on some of this.  \n\nI\'m "allergic" to pineapple.  Those words do come out of my mouth when talking to people but it\'s really just a sensitivity.  \n\nEdit to add:  and if I were asked in this manner, I\'d say it was a sensitivity knowing that the person I\'m speaking to already understands the difference.'
b'Fish sauce frequently is made from fish. Fish.\nI am allergic to crab and scallops, but not shrimp and lobster. Before the allergy became life threatening, I was able ro eat a tiny amount of scallops and crab. Which I loved.\nI agree that dislikes or low tolerances (sulfites for me) declared as allergies, makes kitchen staff become embittered and inclined to act as if the customer in fact will not die if they eat it. My husband will not order either of these foods when we are out, as he fears cross contamination of the plates on they way out. He is correct. Busy restaurants can forget. They will immediately regret it as I collapse on the floor and the ambulance arrives.'
b'Oh, this one gets under my skin soooo much because of two things. First, my wife is pretty seriously allergic to walnuts and pecans. \n\nSecond, I was a cook in a hotel kitchen in college and so have first hand knowledge of health code for dealing with an allergy request and it can really slow down a busy kitchen. Stop, clean any surface that\'s going to cook your food. Swap knives, tongs, spatulas, hand towels, and gloves. Finally, I\'m going to prep and plate your meal in a special place which I will also clean beforehand. All this I am happy to do if you really are allergic because I know how careful one needs to be and how awful it is if you do have a reaction. I still feel incredibly guilty about serving my wife a store bought pesto sauce that used walnuts. I just didn\'t think to check and my wife ended up taking a trip to the ER and staying there the rest of that night and the one after.\n\nIf I hear you are "allergic" to dairy because it will make you a little bloated or something and then later my waitress sees you eating bites of someones creme brulee, I will hate you FOREVER. '
b"This thread is so frustrating. If I told you my allergies, you would hate me. And they are real because I finally got tested at the dr. Every kind of nut, even coconut which is not fun with it being so damned trendy. Walnuts are deadly so I have an epi-pen. Even freaking jalapenos. My dr hasn't seen that before. But, because I'm an adult, I tell people I'm fine and order what doesn't cause an allergic reaction. My allergies are my issue to manage. Not yours. People are dicks. "
b"I have migraines where one of the triggers is partially-hydrogenated soybean oil. This is one type of trans fat used in some processed foods (hot dogs, Tootsie rolls, frozen pizza, frozen lasagna, store bought baked goods, margarine, popcorn, canned refried beans, and even breads can all be laden with this ingredient). Luckily, it's almost never in a restaurant setting, so i don't have to bring it up to my server (migraines caused by this ingredient will totally disable me for a minimum of a day and sometimes up to a week), but i *do* have to bring it up to people who cook for me. It's much easier to call this an allergy than explain the magnitude of the issue as a migraine trigger. \n\nAdditional info just for fun: so few things i eat have this ingredient that I've gotten out of the habit of checking and have poisoned myself before. My hubby is better at checking for this ingredient than i am. "
b'I see posts about allergies on here quite a bit and I honestly don\xe2\x80\x99t get why so many people with allergies go out to eat. I have a bunch of allergies, not all of them will kill me or anything, walnuts and shellfish are the only ones that cause anaphylactic shock, but still. I don\xe2\x80\x99t go out to eat. If I go somewhere with friends or family I pack my own food.\n\nI have had the exact opposite thing happen before though. I have had servers try and convince me that they take serious measures and it is safe for me to eat there. I always say no, I have my own food and I\xe2\x80\x99m fine but some are pretty persistent about it. I appreciate that they offer but it gets annoying if they don\xe2\x80\x99t stop, especially at a place like Denny\xe2\x80\x99s or something where I don\xe2\x80\x99t even really trust the food for people who don\xe2\x80\x99t have allergies(although I did eat there plenty before my allergies got more severe lol). I don\xe2\x80\x99t get it. Why would you want that liability? Just stop. '
b'Not a server but I work at a bar that is basically known for its craft beer.... I get secondhand rage every time I bring food out, have to reassure them that YES the bun is gluten-free, yea I\xe2\x80\x99m sure... and then watch them grab a fistful of fries (which absolutely contain gluten lmfao) and wash it down with a gulp of their beer. People are ridiculous. '
b'On the other hand, I don\xe2\x80\x99t always feel like explaining my private medical information to strangers. I\xe2\x80\x99m gluten free, and usually will say \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m gluten free but cross contamination is fine\xe2\x80\x9d because I KNOW how much work it is to decontaminate every thing. But I\xe2\x80\x99ll still get a dirty look if I order a sandwich on gluten free bread but take a nibble of a regular cookie. Could I say to the server, \xe2\x80\x9cI have a GI motility disorder so eating too much gluten will cause bacteria to ferment in my intestines and require me to take antibiotics for two weeks, but a tiny bite won\xe2\x80\x99t kill me?\xe2\x80\x9d Sure. But it\xe2\x80\x99s my private medical info and I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I should have to. \n\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve also had people take my intolerances less seriously if I refer to them as such. No, I won\xe2\x80\x99t go into anaphylactic shock if I drink milk. Parmesan cheese is fine for me because it is aged. But yes, I will vomit all over your table in about 30 minutes if my hot chocolate has regular milk instead of almond milk.\n\nTrust me, I know some people are assholes and serving is often a thankless job. I\xe2\x80\x99ve also encountered servers who seem to like being the allergy police and \xe2\x80\x9ccatching\xe2\x80\x9d people with foods that don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to line up. But for those of us who have complicated medical issues that require specific diets that may sound strange, we\xe2\x80\x99d just like to eat in peace and not be judged. \n\nETA: I still never claim something is an actual allergy when it isn\xe2\x80\x99t, because those people DO suck. Just sharing a perceptive from the other side. '
b"I'm allergic to mint (including menthol and any kind of peppermint). Thankfully, I'm not deathly allergic. I just develop painful sores on my lips and inside my mouth. Typically a full dose of benedryl will stave of any major reaction and the worst thing that happens is I get a little red.\n\nI have experienced telling a server that it's not a big deal, but mostly because I didn't eat a lot/I had benedryl close by. Granted, I didn't continue eating the dish, but my allergy is mild compared to what a lot of people suffer from. I never thought about it coming off like this. I think in the future I'll choose better wording if it happens again. "
b'Ugh I hate people that insist they have an allergy but still eat the foods with supposed allergen. They ruin it for anybody that has real allergies. My son is allergic to dairy, avocado, and sweet potato. My husband has Crohns and I know his trigger foods. I know exactly what we can and cannot order but some places don\xe2\x80\x99t always take me seriously or will kind of roll their eyes when I have adjustments to my order. \n\nSeriously, if my husband has onions he will end up in the E.R. If my 3 year old eats avocado he will projectile vomit everywhere & end up with hives from head to toe. We don\xe2\x80\x99t always eat out but when we do I have to be diligent because the allergies/intolerances aren\xe2\x80\x99t the norm so they think it\xe2\x80\x99s just being picky. '
b'I have a nut and stone fruit allergy.  The nut allergy isn\xe2\x80\x99t so extreme to the point where my food can\xe2\x80\x99t have any contact with nuts\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s mostly if I consume an actual nut, I will have an anaphylactic reaction.  The stone fruit allergy (peaches, nectarines, plums, etc) is extremely severe with an anaphylactic reaction if I consume RAW and RIPE fruit, but  (google oral allergy syndrome) it\xe2\x80\x99s safe for me to consume COOKED stone fruit (I choose not to though).\n\nI feel like a LOT of servers judge and roll their eyes at me when I tell them this.  It\xe2\x80\x99s important not to take peoples allergies lightly... because they can change, too.  I didn\xe2\x80\x99t develop my allergies until I was in my mid 20s, and first it was just nuts, but then stone fruit followed... so... while I get the frustration with some people that aren\xe2\x80\x99t actually seriously allergic to things, maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s worth the extra time just to be safe, because you have no idea what the anxiety feels like when you take a bite of something and realize it might have an allergen in it that could make you go into anaphylactic shock and possibly kill you.  It\xe2\x80\x99s absolutely traumatic. '
b"While I cannot speak to your specific experience, but as someone who has to follow the LOW fodmap (Fructans, Oligosaccharides, Disaccharides, Monosaccharides, and Polyls) diet, I have to minimize some of those specific carbohydrates. If the cutting board isn't wiped down after cutting onions/garlic (oligosaccharides), I will be fine. But if the chef adds onion/garlic powder to a dish, I will have a rather strong GI reaction. The thing about a fodmap diet is that it is the cumulative ingestion of fodmaps that causes a reaction. Breadcrumbs are tolerable, but a loaf of non-gluten free bread yields the GI reaction.\n\nHow should we address it with the server, since you would ignorantly judge me for saying allergy and then saying it is fine that the chef didn't wipe down the cutting board? \n\nThe problem is, as can be seen by some of the self-righteous and ignorant posts about gluten-free on this sub, that servers do not take you seriously unless you say allergy."
b"There's also a big difference between an allergy and an intolerance to a food.\n\nMy wife has an intolerance to raw onions.  They'll give her a severely upset stomach but it's normally nothing life threatening.  Thankfully, if they are fully cooked, the [denaturing of the at-fault proteins](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/lifestyle/wellbeing/lifecoach/10280925/Life-coach-am-I-allergic-to-onions.html) makes them much more digestible.\n\nNow ginger on the other hand is a severe hazard to her life.  She can't have ginger ale, ginger beer, or anything made with ginger.  Minor cross-contamination is normally not enough to cause anything more than minor discomfort so we usually don't ask for gluten-free levels of prep, but if she ingested any more than trace amounts we'd be off to the ER immediately.\n\nWe also recent learned that something in certain pre-mixed sour mixes that bars used to make drinks with can also set her off.  We have to be very careful to only have that from places that mix their own fresh."
b"When I was still bartending at a high-end 5-star hotel they told us that if a person has an allergy it is their responsibility to tell us. I think they were right, you're the only one who knows and nobody can read your mind. "
b"I work on a management team where I am in charge of the allergens & dietaries list for the entire menu. We have a seperate book where all the ingredients for every dish are written out along with their potential allergens and any kind of dietary requirement such as vegan or low FODMAP. I've even gone to the trouble of noting which FODMAPs are present in which dishes incase someone knows which one/s they can't have. On top of this I've studied nutrition and I'm vegan so I take any allergies or dietaries very seriously. \n\nThe AMOUNT OF TIMES... Argh..\n\nCustomer: *orders food* oh and I can't have gluten\nMe: are you coeliac or is it just an intolerance to gluten?\nC: coeliac. \nM: in that case I would remove x, y, and z from your order as they are all fried with other items that contain wheat flour and there is a likelihood of cross contamination.\nC: oh it's ok I think I've had it here before and didn't have any problems!\n\n///\n\nAnother table after they have already received food from their order, sends part of a dish back with a runner to ask for a vegan alternative (that they didn't request or inform me of initially). \nM: hey guys, here's that other sauce you asked for, who here is the vegan? :)\nDaughter: us two at the end (indicates herself and her mother)\nM: in that case I'll just let you know that the soup you're about to have contains fish stock, would you like me to swap it for the vegan version?\nMother: no thanks it's ok\nMe: oh ok...?\nFather: she's not vegan. \n?????\n\n///\n\nANOTHER table, received food already\nC: is this sauce (that comes with tempura) vegan?\nM: no this one contains fish stock\nC: can I please get a vegan sauce?\nM: sure I can do that, but just so you know the tempura batter contains egg so it isn't vegan either..\nC: that's ok.\n\n///\n\nC: is the sauce that comes with this gluten free?\nM: I'll just need to double check on that one, are you coeliac or intolerant?\nC: I'm allergic to wheat\nM: okay give me one minute before you eat it\nWhile I'm walking back to give her the all clear, customer has already eaten half the dish. \n:) :)\n\nPeople are so confusing."
b'We have people like that ALL the time. I encounter at least 3 or 4 a week. They\xe2\x80\x99ll ask for a gluten free version of eggs Benedict and I tell them there\xe2\x80\x99s gluten in the hollandaise sauce and every time they usually go \xe2\x80\x9coh yeah that\xe2\x80\x99s fine I\xe2\x80\x99m not super allergic just trying to cut back\xe2\x80\x9d I\xe2\x80\x99ve only had a small hand full of people who say no once they find out the sauce has gluten. '
b"I hate my allergy because it's weird. I can't have fresh citrus but for whatever reason I (usually) don't have a problem if it's cooked down. \n\nLike fresh or canned pineapple is a massive no no (my tongue swells up almost instantly). But sufficiently grilled pineapple is no problem.\n\nLemon is my biggest restaurant problem because they put it in everything now. Especially in drinks even when you don't ask. If it's cooked in a dish no problem. But if they squeeze fresh lemon juice (or lime) I immediately can tell.  \n"
b'I had a woman come up to me and loudly tell me about a "very serious life threatening allergy to peanuts" for a table that had already been placed.  \nI straight up told her that the orders were been plated up and that I will have to redo the meal for the person with the allergy and that she should have told us about it before ordering.  \nShe seems fine but is obviously completely ignorant to what a severe allergy is. Anyone with one already knows to ask.  \nI return later to say they we can not serve the person with the sever allergy due to the possibility of cross contamination and the man with the supposed allergy said it\'s, he can have one of the toasties just without as much pesto on it.  \nHe seems quite confused by it but the woman had come in talking about the possibility of anaphylactic shock.'
b'So I can\xe2\x80\x99t eat much fructan, common in onions and garlic, or my stomach decides to try and kill me. What would you recommend I say? I feel bad when I say allergy because cross contamination honestly won\xe2\x80\x99t affect me too much and I don\xe2\x80\x99t want them to have to clean everything but when I say intolerance, people don\xe2\x80\x99t take me seriously and I sometimes end up with visible onions in my food (or worse, invisible garlic and onion powder). Is there a good middle ground? '
b'I used to be a server and I was always so on top of people\'s allergies and dietary restrictions. I worked in a small place so i could darn near remember just about everyone\'s allergy as long as they were semi regular. I had this one lovely girl who had celiac disease and she would bring her own soy sauce so we could cook her food. Never had any problems. But Not all people will tell you that they are allergic to something though. I had a lady that came in with a group, ordered food, and after eating went outside to get something. She came back inside and proceeded to inform me that she was allergic to shrimp. My first response to her was, "Why didn\'t you tell me!?"  I worked at a sushi restaurant that was a hole-in-the-wall, family business, that served multiple types of shellfish. I was really just was dumbfounded by this woman. She wasnt extremely allergic but still had to go outside to take meds to calm the reaction. I also had another customer, whom I forgot had an avocado allergy. I recognized the girl and her family but it had been over a year since they had come in. (They came in about once a year and went ham on food, my goodness). The girl, was an adult, she was there with her two moms and a couple siblings. They all ordered sushi because the moms were pescatarian and allergic to other kinds of meat. Especially chicken. Their adult daughter, the one with the allergy ordered her sushi. Let\'s be clear that for each roll on the list, it gives and overview of what all is in or on the roll. She manages to order a roll with avocado and doesn\'t realize until she eats like two or three piece of it. One of her moms had to run across the street to get her some meds to calm the reaction. When she got back she apologized profusely, saying that she would usually check what her daughter ordered to make sure it didn\'t have avocado in it but she was so excited to eat her own that she forgot. Like I get it, accidents happen. Just please inform your server and pay close attention to what your ordering, especially if obvious ingredients are stated.'
b'Just some perspective from someone who has hesitated when saying something was an allergy and probably was or at least seemed like one of these assholes. I have had chronic pain for years and had doctors telling me to try elimination diets or FODMAP to see if the inflammation was from food intolerances.  I hated being that asshole at a restaurant asking about gluten free stuff or nightshade veggies and also in a kind of state of ambivalence where I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t imagine not eating bread or potatoes.  I had already been limited by my pain so much and suffering depression, so the idea of having to limit even more things that I enjoy was difficult to stick to.  (I\xe2\x80\x99d like to add that I\xe2\x80\x99m a healthy weight so I\xe2\x80\x99m not 600 lbs crying about why do my joints hurt.) Anyway, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why I babbled all this.  Just trying to give a perspective that some of us hate being those assholes that say something is an allergy when we honestly don\xe2\x80\x99t know for sure if it is something our body is intolerant of.'
b"I have a mild allergy to cranberries, of all things.\n\nLuckily cranberries are usually easy to avoid in restaurants, and probably aren't a huge risk of cross-contamination, but I get hives from them and so I avoid foods that have cranberries listed.\n\nMy allergy developed about three years ago and I've only had something with cranberry in it maybe three times since then, but even though I only get hives for now it's possible that it could develop into an anaphylactic reaction if I eat it again."
b"Alright so. I have a mild allergic reaction to orange carrots. My throat get scratchy, I choke slightly on them. In my everyday life I use purple carrots or white carrots and for whatever reason they don't bother me.\nOnce I was ordering a dish that the menu listed as having carrots. My boyfriend notices while I'm ordering and says something to me with the waitress standing right there so I ask if they can sub the carrots for another vegetable.\nIt turns out the carrots are like one of the ingredients of the dish. So not really possible to sub out.\nBut the waitress is now aware of the allergy and clearly worried about me. I'm embarrassed and have to tell her it's fine, that the reaction is very mild and I just would have preferred a different side as I won't eat them by themselves if I can help it.\nThis waitress (to my embarrassed brain anyway) clearly thinks now that I just don't like carrots and I was trying to be a special snowflake about getting a different side dish."
b'I have a *very* mild gluten allergy. *Very* mild. I am sometimes at a loss of how to convey that, no, you don\'t have to give me any special treatment, yes, I am allergic, but no, it certainly wont harm me. I could eat a pound of pasta if my stomach let me and be relatively fine, absolutely no hospital visit would be required. Sometimes I ask for the gluten free menu as I\'m feeling sensitive that day, other days I\'m eating pasta, bread, and/or pizza because I dont have any fucks left to give and want to enjoy myself. Anyone have good ideas on how to convey this? Lately I\'m just saying, when I ask for the gluten free menu "you guys dont have to wash down the whole kitchen for me, and it\'s cool if my gluten free pasta is cooked in a pot that had gluten pasta in it." '
b'Not an allergy but I had a lady accuse me of using canned beets.  I went to the kitchen and grabbed a whole pan of roasting beets from the oven and plopped them on the table.  No apology for calling me a liar.  '
b">Or you had a dine and dash that you had to pay for, and it costed more than the entire tip that you earned during that shift?\n\nThis is illegal in every state. Contact your state's department of labor."
b'Your employer only has to raise your hourly if you make less than minimum for the pay period, not per shift.'
b"Man, that fucking sucks! I live in Canada and it's illegal for servers to pay for bitches who dine and dash. That doesn't mean that employers will follow the law, tho. While working at East Side Mario's (it was so shit, I still get nightmares from this shit hole). One of my friend's tables left the restaurant without leaving enough change and the manager on duty made her pay the missing amount which was $5 but fuck that! On another occasion, a friend had a party of 30 people who all paid separate. They were so many fucking people that they made a line to pay only for my friend to find out at the end of her shift that one of those assholes have left without paying. Another manager on duty made her pay the full bill. The following day, she confronted the owner and reminded her that it was illegal for employees to pay for somebody who had dined and dashed and the owner said that she'd only have to pay for half. My friend agreed but she was not happy at all. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've had to pay to work especially when cheap hoes and dumb asses don't tip but I still have to tip out. It's not so much about the money ($3 at most), it's more about the principle. But, it all depends on where you work as well. I used to work at this place in which if a customer didn't tip, you weren't expected to tip out on that specific bill."
b"This reminds me of an 8 top I got on a very very slow night. Where I work there's is an auto- gratuity on 8 or more when using a credit card. When I dropped off the check I explained that he only needed to sign, he left an extra 50$ tip. The bill was about 400 something. They bought 3 bottles of wine, 3 appetizers, and all of them had main entrees (about 25-30$ each). The whole night they talked to me and joked around. They were the best table I ever had."
b'One server told me about a customer that got upset because we dont carry tartar sauce.  We are known for ribs and burgers.  We got like 3 seafood items on the menu, and one of them is a clam chowder appetizer.  You dont come here looking for seafood.'
b"Why don't kids in North America eat smaller portions of what adults eat, like in other countries? I grew up doing this in the US. Even in restaurants my parents would order regular meals with extra plates and split them between us kids. We grew up with spicy foods, things it grieves me to say my grandchildren wouldn't touch, and I don't understand why children are treated so differently when there's no reason for them not to eat the same foods. "
b"I work at a steakhouse, and people ask if we have enchiladas, spaghetti, etc. Or people just sit down and order mozzarella sticks or wontons. Like, I'm not sure where people get the idea that these foods are served at every restaurant ever."
b"We've had three separate people ask for Ranch Dressing at work. No Mexican Restaurant let alone a Mexican Food Truck has any reason to carry Ranch Dressing. I've also had someone ask if we served wings like we were a Buffalo Wild Wings or something. "
b'Regulars like this are the best! Why I love doing what we do. Fuck all the assholes. People like this always make it better. '
b'thought this would go much differently. hope you have many more guests as compassionate as this!'
b'Lol this reminds me of when I was working at this one venue where we had an amazing team, they changed management and on the first meeting with the new manager she tells us that we have to "prove our worth" to her. \n\n  \nAfter hearing that I got up and walked out to go find another job.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBitch we\'ve been keeping this boat afloat (Always Top 10 on Trip Advisor in the area during that time) while the owner has been dealing with his divorce and cocaine problems, and you gonna tell me I have to earn my place here? Peace out.  \n'
b"If the GM is getting all this feedback, maybe he'd better do something about it.  Otherwise, he's part of the problem."
b'Yup my boss just did the same thing to me. I was skeptical of the place because I noticed that 80% of the people were quitting only one waitress had been there longer than a year. I\xe2\x80\x99m over the top nice to the customers but apparently \xe2\x80\x9chad a couple complaints\xe2\x80\x9d. If they\xe2\x80\x99re going to only employ their servers a short time to deal with high maintenance customers then they need to advertise is as a temporary position because it makes us look stupid when we have to tell the next employer why we were there a short time. These types of managers need to be careful with karma because it\xe2\x80\x99s not like they can\xe2\x80\x99t get complained about on yelp...'
b'A "regular" would know you charge for each drink. This guy was just being an asshole, and your manager should know better than to throw you under the bus. '
b'I\'ve worked in the same restaurant for just over 4 years, since the first day it opened. It\'s super frustrating when people try to pull the whole "well the last time I was here, you guys had/did blah blah blah" when I know with 100% certainty that they\'re wrong. There\'s no real way to correct them without implying that they\'re either lying or that they\'re confusing us with another place and don\'t know what they\'re talking about. I still haven\'t figured out how to handle that kind of thing politely, so as soon as that shit starts, it\'s the manager\'s problem.'
b'I\xe2\x80\x99ve worked in restaurant and retail and this type of behavior is common throughout the service industry. People seem to have this idea that if someone\xe2\x80\x99s job is to bring them something they are automatically above them on the socioeconomic ladder and then treat them\n accordingly. \nYou did nothing wrong it\xe2\x80\x99s not in your job description to be berated or talked down to by your general manager.  You didn\xe2\x80\x99t get upset but you stood up for yourself. And if this isn\xe2\x80\x99t a revelation about how shitty people can be you at least know hat your manager doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have your back. '
b"I'm'a keep it real with you chief. If you suspect that someone is going to be a problem customer, you need to cover all your bases. Yes, the customer was an a**hole, but a lot of people are, so you need to be ready to ensure that you cannot in any way, shape, or form be thought to be at fault. It may seem tedious to repeat things to every customer, but it helps to avoid those kinds of situations. Also, your manager is spineless. "
b'I\'ve spent a good amount of time serving tables before moving into management. Honestly, you said it in your first sentence - you get a lot of tourists. I would take the time to gently let tables know their drinks "will be by the glass". Number one, you avoid these types of conflicts. Number two, getting ahead of these situations are in the nature of the job, like covering specials and other aspects that you would expect from your server if you were out to eat. And especially if you\'re a tourist in a new town.\n\nNow I\'m not saying this guy is right, and he sounds like he\'s completely bullshitting about being a regular. But I would expect my staff to be on top of this if I were the manager on duty. I understand the no refill policy, but again not everybody is local and knows.\n\nAssuming is going to cause more headache than its worth in the long run. '
b"The absurd practice of giving free soda refills occurs in the majority of restaurants. Many places even offer free to go cups of the stuff. You knew that management even had a policy of caving on refill charges. You knew what you were doing. You, the professional copped an attitude and set-up the confrontation. As a business owner for 34 years, with many long term staff, you wouldn't make the cut. I recommend you be more honest with yourself about your responsibility as a server to make the guests experience as pleasant as possible and get return business for your employer."
b">I work in nyc. Not even McDonald\xe2\x80\x99s does free refills here.\n\nSeriously?  That's stupid.\n\n>A concerned customer generally asks or if someone pitches a fit, we comp it. Explaining every time is tedious and honestly kind of rude on my part.\n\nUm...NYC gets a ton of tourists from other parts of the country.  In the vast majority of America, drink refills for soda are free.  It's poor customer service for you to not explain to guests that soda refills cost money."
b'I faced this once as a customer. Once. I accepted my mistake and clarify every time from then on.\n\nGrow the fuck up you shouldnt be drinking 4 diet cokes anyways.\n\nHowever i will say that asking if Id like another to me sounds like offering a refill. You dont ask if Id want another burger yknow?  Because you live in a city that gets a lot of tourists and a country where free refills are standard I do think your restaurant should have a better policy.\n\nOr maybe humans should stop being whiny brats who get upset over every misstep, forcing customer service to tie itself into knots...'
b'I\'m a regular at several neighborhood places that I visit from once a week to once a month.  At a couple of these places, the turnover is so high that if I go out of town for a month and come back, I don\'t recognize half the staff.  And then a new server will insist to me "We\'ve never done that, I\'ve been working here 5 months!"  Okay, fine.  I\'ve been a customer for five years, but let\'s do it your way.   '
b'Lol if he\xe2\x80\x99s a \xe2\x80\x9cregular\xe2\x80\x9d, then he should know what the prices are? I hate the fact that if we defend ourselves to the customers, when THEY are the ones in the wrong, then to our managers we\xe2\x80\x99re the ones being rude and disrespectful.  I don\xe2\x80\x99t see anything wrong with what you said, I\xe2\x80\x99m definitely on your side. Kudos to you for keeping your cool with the RM, I would\xe2\x80\x99ve lost my patience the second he said the soup was cold.'
b"Your manager is an asshat.  It is the guests responsibility to read the menu and understand what they are ordering.  It is not your responsibility to go over pricing.  That is why menu's exist."
b'Anytime you give a customer a truthful answer like that it\'s always "mean" because then they realize that they\'re idiots. '
b"I'm jealous you don't give free refills. Those diet soda people always need about seven and it's a huge time suck."
b"How long have you worked here? What's your real job? Why don't you go to college (graduated 25 yrs ago, everyone needs 2 jobs now, DUH.) I don't understand tipping/I don't believe in tipping/Get a real job. "
b'i work at a fairly new (5 months) mexican restaurant, previously it was american food right. now it\xe2\x80\x99s very apparent we are mexican food, agave murals all over(we specialize in tequila and mezcal), maps of mexico, all your typical mexican restaurant stuff. so the other day i\xe2\x80\x99m greeting a table, and while this man is looking at our appetizer menu (ceviche, queso, flautas) he says \xe2\x80\x9cdo you guys still have cheese curds?\xe2\x80\x9d it was obvious he knew he was in a different restaurant!! people blow my mind. \xe2\x80\x9cyes sir, we kept that one dish just because everyone loved it\xe2\x80\x9d ignorance is bliss i guess '
b'(Paraphrasing)\nGuy: Can you help me do something with my phone?\nServer: Sorry I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how to do what you are asking. \nGuy: You\xe2\x80\x99re Asian, shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you know how to do this? \n\nLike really?? Server was pissed for the rest of the shift. She also said the rest of the table looked really uncomfortable. '
b'I work in a Chinese restraunt and the amount of times people come in and try to order sushi makes me want to kill myself, also doesn\'t really help that there\'s a sushi restraunt literally one shop over from us. Someone berated me by asking why we don\'t do sushi, maybe it\'s becasue we are different cultures? \n\nI also keep on having people try to greet in Chinese or Japanese or say Ni Hao, what do you think you\'ll get by doing that? Once a guy came in and tried that and then said "can I speak to Mrs. Miyagi?" '
b"At a self order kiosk I heard a customer get mad because we were very understaffed and didn't have someone to run our counter at the moment, they didn't want their order put into a damn computer. What the hell do you think the register at the counter is?"
b'Why would you allow them to bring in outside food?\n\nAnd turning away thousands of dollars of business to avoid setting limits is not a good business model - not even from a customer service point of view because you pissed off a lot of better, more valuable customers in the process'
b'Honestly your manager should have shut that shit down. One seat per ass. Presents do not get their own table. No outside food.\n\nNow im not super heartless. I would have politely said we dont normally allow this but will make an exception, however if it gets busy we cannot allow you to monopolize so many tables.\n\nThe second you had to turn customers away, manager should have been asking for the tables to be clear. '
b"You could suggest that everyone that encounters him try doing to him what he's been doing to you. Talk in a normal tone at first, but each time he acts like he can't hear you, lower your voice a little bit. Keep doing that, and eventually he really won't be able to hear you.\n\nAs for you not being able to hear HIM, just ask politely the questions you have to ask. If you can't tell if he wants a combo or sandwich, give him the sandwich. Or the combo, if you prefer. Although it would probably be easier to adjust the order if you give him a sandwich, rather than a combo. Although it means you have to charge him more. Your manager may end up giving him the fries and drink for free though, so you might prefer to give him a refund by charging him for a combo instead. Personally, I'd do the combo.\n\nIf he complains, tell him you thought he said whichever you chose for him. And put his food in a bag, if you can't tell if he wants it to go. And make up a nice name for him, and holler it out for him. Make sure to give him full eye contact, and wave that bag at him.\n\nIf everyone does this, consistently, then he might actually start working on his attitude. You can explain to your manager that you simply couldn't hear him, so you based his order off what you thought he said. Yeah, it might cause some problems. But if everyone does it, then it may turn things around."
b"The one thing I hate is rude, entitled people. You were on the polite side of what that curse-tomer deserved. Thank goodness he didn't pitch a massive hissy fit"
b'I work in a restaurant\xe2\x80\x99s bar and really only get swamped when there\xe2\x80\x99s a long wait for a table, so people who are waiting 30+ minutes for a table come to the bar and expect service immediately. We do a good job of keeping up but sometimes people have to wait a minute or two. \n\nMore than once I\xe2\x80\x99ve been snapped at, or get someone who just starts yelling their order at me while I\xe2\x80\x99m getting an order from someone else or making like 5 different drinks. \n\nI say \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll be right with you\xe2\x80\x9d and I promise I\xe2\x80\x99m trying but I can only keep so many things in my head at once. It\xe2\x80\x99s bizarre how much of a hurry people are in to get their drinks so they can go back to the lobby and continue waiting for a table. '
b"I'm baffled that some people manage to get through each day without accidentally killing themselves and others."
b'If you\'re a minority, I have an idea as to why she wouldn\'t speak to your face\n\nEdit: wtf are these downvotes? Racist people exist and will go so far as to not make eye contact and speak with people who are "lesser" than them'
b'Definitely brush up on being able to properly do wine service for a table. Learning about the wines themselves can come later on once your familiar with how management likes service to be run.  Make sure when you are clearing plates/cutlery from tables you are not stacking plates on the table in front of guests but are able to stack them on one of your forearms while clearing with your other free hand and when dropping food or drinks or clearing always try to do it from the right side if it\xe2\x80\x99s possible.  When re-setting guests for their next course place the cutlery on their right side, fork always left of the knife. Also, not something everyone does but if guests are up from the table and have left their cloth napkin on their chair or scrunched up on the table I\xe2\x80\x99ll fold it for them or if it\xe2\x80\x99s dirty I\xe2\x80\x99ll replace it for them before they return. Also be sure to be helping out other servers when you can, I hate when servers care about no tables but their own, teamwork is very importantly obviously. Most importantly remember to be warm and professional at all times, no need to be robotic, there are ways to do this and still be fun and hospitable.  As someone who has managed a bit before the thing that bothers me most about servers making the transition to fine dining or upscale dining is as soon as they leave a table and are out of view of guests they start talking shit, complaining, or look like they are having a bad time that immediately tells me they aren\xe2\x80\x99t a good fit, they likely have bad vibes at the table, and don\xe2\x80\x99t actually have any passion for food or drink. Lastly, have fun and good luck!'
b'One guest asked for ketchup a few days ago with a dry aged ribeye, but the really stupid part of it was when he said, \xe2\x80\x9cIf its good \xe2\x80\x98nuff fer our prezdint, its good \xe2\x80\x98nuff fer me!  Haw haw haw!\xe2\x80\x9d'

b"I work in a cafe and I usually have very bad gas towards the end of the day. \n\nAs I'm packing down 5 mins to close a whole ass family walks in and sits down with their baby. As I'm packing down I have to walk up and down the cafe floor a lot.\n\nEverypass I took a fart found it's way to them. They were silent and short but effective none the less. They were so bad they blamed it on the baby.\n\nThere was another time I was around the corner in the wash yo room and I ripped ass, super loud one too. I was laughing my tiddies off and as I walked around the corner to my horror there was a customer stood there...laughing stopped pretty snappy. Especially as there is no music playing and no other customers."
b'That\'s great! Whenever I feel one brewing I like to offer my crop dusting services to my coworkers.\n\n"Any tables pissing you off tonight?"\n\nI try to be a team player'
b'I used to guiltily crop dust because I could never get a second to use the restroom. Now working in retail I happily do it because watching the reactions from afar makes me giggle.'
b'I used to have a raging pervert of a GM that I would crop dust every chance I got.  Sweet stinky justice.'
b"I'm km but not hiring manager. We once brought on a lead that would make our kitchen guys cut fries for her in half long ways and refry them, no matter how busy(the fries are steak cut and I assure 10 minute breaks between 7 and 8 for my closing staff no matter how busy, they can eat on it, smoke, whatevs). She even went so far as to not let a grill cook know she was behind him. He swung, lost 2 burgers colliding with her in doing so, and she proceeded to rip him a new one. In front of me. She didn't finish that week. "
b"well, my coworker isn't as rude as them (fuck them, though -- they are Kevin/Karen in training), but I have this coworker who asks me to cover fro him with merely 2-3 hours before the shift starts -- I had to turn him down on multiple occasions because I had things to do.\n\n(also annoying when he texts me on NYD to cover for him when I am at a Korean spa relaxing after a hellish marathon of 13 days nonstop work over the holidays.)"
b"I work at a relatively popular all night diner in the south-eastern U.S. We do not have FoH, BoH separation...the entire staff is visible to the customers, and we have a unique way for our servers to place their orders. If you've been in one you probably know where this is. This is not my first time working for this company as it is a good company to work for. I was once asst. mgr. to one of the top performing stores in our region. After about 15 years away from the company i returned and have now met the absolutely worst server i have ever encountered (with 30+ years of food service experience overall). Somehow she keeps her job even though she has had to transfer stores on more than one occasion because the staff have refused to work with her. She habitually leaves tables dirty for hours when customer flow is low. Then demands (not asks) that other servers help her clean her tables and dishes (servers wash their own) when an actual rush of customers begins. She regularly fails to get silverware and drinks to the table (at times having to cancel a drink order when a customer pays).  In over a year she has not been able to learn the ordering system and food regularly has to be comped due to inaccurate orders being placed. Customers have walked out after watching her return from the restroom without washing her hands. She lies to new hires about policy, and even UN-ironically accused me of being a Demon to management. The list goes on but i don't want to ramble, just vent a bit. Somehow this server still has a job. I deeply sympathize with anyone coping with nightmare coworkers.  "
b'Vanilla paste? Sorry "chef" but I use vanilla beans and cook them down in the cream....you can have your pre-made crap at home '
b"You shouldn't tip someone who gives bad service.\n\nIf they give you decent service and there is no room for complaint from what they did (not getting the table you wanted or the kitchen messing something up shouldn't count against them), then you need to tip. \n\nI'm not saying it the best system for the guests, but that's how it works here. "
b"You do not have to tip your server if they give you poor service. However be aware of the situation around you before you assume your server is giving you poor service. If your server is outright being lazy and looks like they don't care about their job, then that's poor service, but if they're trying their best especially on a busy night then you should give them some leniency and especially do not blame them if your food comes out wrong or take a long time to come out because that's on the cooks/expo, not them. "
b'Hi I\xe2\x80\x99m from the uk too.  I live off my tips and manage to make a decent wage by people who tip me.  I work my ass off to make people have an enjoyable service, and if someone wants table service, it\xe2\x80\x99s ALWAYS been a thing in the uk to tip.  We tip taxi drivers, delivery drivers, bartenders and servers.  This is not new, I\xe2\x80\x99m 31 and my parents have always tipped.  I\xe2\x80\x99m lucky though, because my American brothers and sisters in service don\xe2\x80\x99t get a fair wage a lot of the time and therefore tips subsidise their pay, especially seeing as they usually have to tip out to their support staff.  Occasionally this means if they haven\xe2\x80\x99t been tipped by many tables, they are actually paying to be at work.  Tipping is important.  The whole \xe2\x80\x98gET a BeTtER JoB\xe2\x80\x99 thing isn\xe2\x80\x99t realistic when some people are single parents taking on work to work around childcare, or students who want or have to pay their way, or just people who are doing what they can to make ends meet with what they have to offer or what their town has to offer.  Hospitality is mentally and physically demanding and a few quid here and there to show appreciation really isn\xe2\x80\x99t going to break the bank.  A lot of people live paycheck to paycheck these days and those tips keep them afloat.'
b'Because in our culture we have 3 types of eating: take away (look at me being all multicultural and shit), to go at a restaurant,  and full service. \n\nFull service is exactly what it sounds like. I\'m servicing your every whim. From modifying what you order, to putting only 3 ice cubes in your drink. Eating will take an hour or more, during which time I\'m waiting on you hand and foot. So you tip for that service. If you dont want to tip, take away is for you. If you want to tip a bit less, to go is for you. \n\nIt\'s the difference between using a bellhop and carrying your own luggage. You have the choice, but if you use the service, you\'ve got to pay for it. \n\nPeople take the service and think it\'s an option to pay for it. I cant tell the utility company " I dont believe on paying the service fee to turn my power on. So I\'m not gonna." And still have it turned on. Serving and other tip dependent jobs seem to be the only place where that behavior is acceptable. \n\nWhy are we so focused? Because, if a customer doesnt tip , I cant tell the fucking light company that I wont pay the service fee. I just dont have lights. '
b'Here\xe2\x80\x99s a mind twister, many hairdressers in Germany rely on tips'
b'Why are they ? So if your paid a awful wage how are u supposed to tip when you go out'
b'I got a job programming for restaurant POS systems and the hourly is $5.75 over minimum wage... I still don\xe2\x80\x99t make as much as serving but I get awesome healthcare and benefits and a stable schedule... there are pros and cons to every job.. I\xe2\x80\x99ll probably go back to school and serve my way through.. \n\n\nMaybe you could try a new restaurant though?? '
b'I worked at a call center doing dispatch for an alarm company. Now I\xe2\x80\x99m doing DoorDash and Postmates delivery which pays well when it\xe2\x80\x99s busy. Honestly, if you want to make more money or have a better job then invest a bit of money in a trade school. Or work at a call center and work your way up until you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to deal with customers anymore. \n\nIncidentally, the restaurant I worked at just burned down tonight. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t love it there but it was still really sad. It was a local favorite. '
b"I feel you man, I've been serving for the past 2.5 years just bc the money is good. I'm currently waiting to get my permanent residence in Canada which is why I haven't gone to school. As as international student, I'm expected to pay 45k/year on an arts degree. I'd rather buy a car, thank you, next!"
b'I run late pretty much always, and I now have dreams that I\xe2\x80\x99m running late to work and can\xe2\x80\x99t find clothes, or other dream obstacles \xf0\x9f\x99\x84 or then i am working without my proper tools or some other horrible situation. '
b'I don\xe2\x80\x99t have nightmares... just that when you get off at midnight and have to open the next morning is enough for me'
b'I had a dream once that I was the only server on in a hotel grill in NYC I worked at in the fancy main dining room. they were making me waitress and also cook all the eggs on a single two burner hot plate in the back. when I cracked the eggs rats came out of them and were running out of the pan into the dining room and the manager I desperately wanted approval from was yelling at me about rats in the dining room. 7 years later it still sticks with me.'
b'YES BITCH. I\xe2\x80\x99ve had people snap and CLAP in my face/as I pass to get my attention or make their point. \n\nWhy are older people always so entitled when they\xe2\x80\x99re drinking? Like, okay Deborah, I get that you ordered a vodka cranberry and you\xe2\x80\x99re mad that it tastes like more like vodka than cranberries, but get the absolute fuck outta my face. Then and ONLY then- it might get fixed to your liking. Maybe. Geez. '
b'Go OP! I say from experience, working in a bar with the ability to tell customers how you actually feel can be very satisfying. I have a group of baby boomers that comes in every Thursday night and likes to order food EXACTLY at 6pm. On an extremely busy Thursday with only myself and another waitress I asked their table at 5:50 if they wanted to order and they declined. It being busy, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get over there right at 6pm and one them actually got out a whistle! Wtf!! I ignored him blowing the whistle as long as I could until he started continually blowing the whistle. I finally came over to him and told him he\xe2\x80\x99s better off going down the road to get McDonalds because he\xe2\x80\x99s not getting served here tonight.'
b"I love a negroni. Yet EVERY one of my friends who has had a sip hates them as far too bitter and tasting like cough syrup. I'd be amazed if I heard someone order four for their group. But as someone on your side of the counter (food though not booze) I know that you have to assume if they know the name they know what they're ordering. Because the scorn from Karen if you try to gently explain what she'll be getting and I'm not going to remake an accurate order is naaaaasty! "
b'Just yesterday I dropped off a tray of house salads to a 10 top, as I am handing them all out I say *directly to the gentleman who asked for it*, "I will be right back with the caeser salad for you, sir".  I turn around to pick up the tray and head back to the line to grab his salad (I couldn\'t fit EVERYTHING on the tray, I\'m not a miracle worker) and he SNAPS HIS FINGERS AT ME and goes, "My salad?".  I wanted to scream in his face, jesus christ.'
b'last year I was handing out drinks to a table of 5 and while I was passing them out an older man reached his hand down into my apron to get a straw. he could tell I was uncomfortable and said \xe2\x80\x9cwhat, was that not PC of me? I needed a straw.\xe2\x80\x9d and proceeded to laugh about it with his group. I can\xe2\x80\x99t even make this stuff up. '
b'I also say something similar when a guest asks me for something that I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t give them to right that very second. Just a few weeks ago I had a huge party and was passing out the food when a middle aged woman said \xe2\x80\x9cexcuse me, you FORGOT my ranch.\xe2\x80\x9d I told her it\xe2\x80\x99s right on the tray, with extra napkins and refills. Shit drives me nuts, wait literally 2 seconds before you start demanding things! '
b'This happens to me ALL THE TIME. \n\nThe straws at my restaurant don\xe2\x80\x99t have paper sleeves on them, so every time someone asks for a straw, I have to go back to the wait station, grab it with a paper napkin and bring it to the guest. If more than one person asks, I usually just put them in a wine glass. It does get very annoying though, especially when we\xe2\x80\x99re busy.\n\nAt least you can carry them in your apron!\n'
b'Take the drink, put it back on the tray, take the tray back to the back, set it down, come back, hand them a straw, then go back for the tray '
b'I actually use straws because my teeth are too sensitive to cold for me not to use a straw...and more often than not, people forget that I asked for no ice.\n\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve been seeing some really good reusable straws on Amazon though and I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking about getting some of those.  Anyone have any experience with those?'
b'I\xe2\x80\x99d be tempted to put down the entire tray and then give them a straw, then ask if anybody else urgently needs one.\n\nThen again, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been fired a lot. '
b'People do this all the time. Can\xe2\x80\x99t stand it. If I have more than 3 drinks, I\xe2\x80\x99ll use a tray, set the tray on an empty table (if available) and then pass the drinks and grab the straws. \n\nIt takes about 0.5284629 milliseconds between setting drink A down and reaching to the nearby table for drink B before hearing a \xe2\x80\x9cdO yOu HaVe A sTrAW?!?\xe2\x80\x9d \n\nYes, lady. They\xe2\x80\x99re literally right here in mah apron. Give me 2 seconds and I got you. \n\nYou\xe2\x80\x99d think they\xe2\x80\x99d coat these straws with heroin or something. '
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t have enough hands\xe2\x80\x9d is a wonderful little server saying. It\xe2\x80\x99s part of my script on busy nights to keep things light. '
b'i was setting down apps/salads for a 20 top a couple years ago, and when i finished handing everything out i asked if anyone needed anything. i started on one end and a few peopke said they wanted a side of ranch, a refill, a water, etc. as i got back around to where i started a lady (who hadn\'t even asked for anything for herself) in a rude tone says "she didn\'t get her side of ranch!"\n\nI LITERALLY HAVE NOT LEFT THE TABLE SINCE YOU ASKED FOR IT'
b'California recently implemented a plastic straw ban so we\'re no longer allowed to automatically give straws with drinks anymore. So now we get some customers who just bark "STRAW!" No "straw, please" or "can we get some straws please", just straight up "STRAW." Have some manners!'
b"Dude, we give out straws by default, and people are still like this to me. It's gotten to the point where I just bring straws when I see I've gotten a new table, before I even take drink orders. Even still, though, people lack the perception to see that there are bright white-wrappered straws in the middle of the damn table..."
b'Even at places where they give me a straw by default, my experience is that generally the server will hand out drinks and _then_ straws, once their hands are free.'
b'I work at a luxury hotel, in one of their bars/restaurants and we\xe2\x80\x99ve gone to straws only on request too, and people are so rude and indignant about it. Like they act like I\xe2\x80\x99m completely retarded and incompetent, and speak down to me because they aren\xe2\x80\x99t given straws. Then I have to give them the whole \xe2\x80\x9coh it\xe2\x80\x99s only on request, protect the environment\xe2\x80\x9d spiel and they still want straws regardless. I have no idea what America\xe2\x80\x99s obsession with single use plastics is but it\xe2\x80\x99s gotta stop.'
b'My first thought: NEED or WANT? \n\nBut yeah, I get a lot of customers who ask it in such a way that makes it seem like I\'m offending them by not giving them a straw with their drink. \n\nThe only exception is that I always give straws with kids drinks because they have lids. One night the restaurant was running low on straws so I was explaining to people that I was trying to save the straws for the kiddos, and one guy practically yelled at me "Are you saying I can\'t have a straw?!" Now I understand that sometimes older people have trouble drinking without straws or sometimes people have sensitive teeth, so I responded "No, you may of course have one if you really need it". I went to get him a straw and came back to find that they had just asked another server, who gave the entire table straws (including the teenagers and parents who could have gone without)'
b"I can't not have a straw. It bugs the crap out of me to drink without one, and I hate it when the server escapes before I remember to ask for one. Offering them is perfect. Of course waiting for one is no problem, I just hate it when I don't have one and the server is MIA. "
b"I may be guilty of this. In a busy place the server isn't at your table very long, so you feel the pressure to ask for everything you need as soon as you have their attention. I'd rather seem a little over eager than have to wait until the next time you come over to take a drink. "
b"And the vast majority of this country's trash is nowhere near the ocean and doesnt make it more than 10 miles from their homes. Hell, my local landfill in kentucky takes trash that used to go to staten island. It comes in via the Stink Train. "
b'I was given a paper straw in Florida last year and it sucked. Every time I used it it was dry and stuck to my lips. It was like nails on a chalkboard. I think a simple coat of wax would make them tolerable. '
b'I just don\xe2\x80\x99t get why people come into a restaurant already looking to have an issue. \n\nLike, the people who don\xe2\x80\x99t even give you a millisecond to give them a straw before they\xe2\x80\x99re barking at you probably already made up their mind to be inconvenienced about it the second they walked through the door. \n\nThese are the same types of a-holes who put a stack of bills on the table at the start of service and tell you that it\xe2\x80\x99s your tip and if you mess up, they\xe2\x80\x99ll take dollars away and whatever\xe2\x80\x99s left you get to keep.\n\nJerks.'
b"I don't want a straw 90% of the time. If it's not a milkshake I really don't need one. On top of being wasteful they cause you to swallow air and so you either burp or pass gas. \nThank you for not serving drinks with them already in."
b'Its not a rule in my restaurant , but I was trying to save on straws and such , I got some of the worst looks , I had to just go back to my old ways.. '
b'I work for Starbuck\xe2\x80\x99s. \nIn Seattle.\nIf ever there was a population of entitled customers worried about their (now compostable) straws, it\xe2\x80\x99s them. \n\nI totally get it. \n\nEdit: I waited tables in undergrad, I understand the tone... everything... about this post.\nHang in there. \n\nEdit Edit: for me, it\xe2\x80\x99s the cup carrier. \n\xe2\x80\x9cCan I get that cup carrier?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbsolutely! I heard you over at the register.. so sorry about that! Let me get these drinks (in my mind I\xe2\x80\x99m muttering \xe2\x80\x98let me get all 7 of these drinks\xe2\x80\x99) ready and we will start with the cup carriers.\xe2\x80\x9d\n::::::jumping Jesus on a pogo stick::::::'
b'Where I live the area banned plastic straws. My restaurant went no straws period for a while. Then because of the general pissy fits we have to deal with now we offer reusable straws for purchase. People act like I literally ran over their puppy in front of them over telling them they have to buy a straw. '
b'Why can we not go back to the old-style paper straws?'
b'\\>"Would anyone like a straw? **We only give straws upon request because of their affect on the environment.**" \n\nyou don\'t need this part as it\'s passive aggressive'
b'Omgggg I hate this so much!! Why do people freak out that they don\xe2\x80\x99t have a straw right away? When they ask me like that I usually just kinda chuck it in front of them. \n\nReminds me of my shift the other day when I had a fulllll tray of deserts, coffee etc etc. I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to set desert and coffees down and this lady is like \xe2\x80\x9cWHERES MY CREAM, I NEED CREAM.\xe2\x80\x9d Omfg. So I set every single item down that I could as slow as I could and then lastly set her cream in front of her. \xf0\x9f\x98\x82'
b'I\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten in the habit of having straws in my hand or apron when I greet the table, but only enough for the amount of people sitting there, then before I leave to go to get their drinks I\xe2\x80\x99ll ask if anyone \xe2\x80\x9cneeds\xe2\x80\x9d a straw right then and there. It saves me from grabby or rude people demanding them when my hands are full.'
b'God I feel this! Like calm down dude, I have to hand out all your damn milkshakes give me a minute! I feel you OP, such a pet peeve of mine. '
b'Its like I wrote this post myself, I experience this every shift. '
b"I love this! I don't work in a restaurant anymore but I can't count the amount of times some smart ass would ask where their meal/drink/whatever is when they could clearly see my hands are full to capacity. Oh yes, let me just get your steak for you, I shoved it up my arsehole just here so I could carry it to the table along with the other 4 plates!!!\n\nI bet this moment and their reactions are always sooo satisfying for you."
b"Personally, I'd like to see restaurants start using stainless steel straws. They're washable, can be disinfected easily, and it's really no different from using the restaurant's knives or forks. Plus, the restaurant wouldn't have to keep buying them, and there's no waste involved.\n\nI gave up disposable straws over a year ago, so I'd love to not have to carry my reusable straw with me when I go out to eat."
b"Not entirely relevant, but I'm guessing the reason a lot of restaurants are trying to limit for many straws the give out is to save money and has nothing to do with the environment. \n\nIt just sounds better to save the environment than to say that we just want to save money. "
b"At least once or twice a day, someone asks about their drink. I understand people can occasionally forget but, your drink was literally the thing I am reaching for right after handing you your order just wait an additional two seconds and you will have it. Whenever people ask about their drink and I haven't forgotten it, I always just nonchalantly slide it into view to show them that it is right here, you just couldn't see it from your perspective. "
b'They all just think we have 10 hands. \n\nI hate when I have a table of 4 or more (but usually get it more with 4 tops), and I can usually bring out 3 plates at a time depending how heavy the plates are. I bring out the 3 plates to go back and grab the last plate, but before I do and actually say I\xe2\x80\x99ll be back with the last plate, it\xe2\x80\x99s always a condescending, \xe2\x80\x9c where is my plate?\xe2\x80\x9d \n\nI only have two hands!'
b"Maybe if it happens every night, you should make your spiel *before* you set down the drinks? Just sayin'.  I don't think I'd be that person who demanded a straw right away, but I do need to use a straw as my teeth are sensitive to cold... I might be afraid you'd move down the table and I'd have to raise my voice to ask it...?\n\nYes, I'm playing devil's advocate here, but it seems to be causing you some stress. I can almost see you tense up as you approach the table as you think to yourself 'wait for it...' \n\nGirl, don't make your job harder than it is. Ask yourself why someone might say *I need a straw, please* and not have the courtesy to wait until you have served all of the drinks. Your customers aren't there to make your life easier, it's the opposite!\n\nI haven't even read any of the other replies yet, I just had to blurt it out right away. When I was in the restaurant business, I had every job from dish bitch to f and b manager. It's a service industry. You are there to make guests feel comfortable. Wanting them to wait until your hands are empty (and what's up with that? One hand for the tray, the other for the drink or a cocktail napkin or a straw or **money** if you're a cocktail waitress!) Why can't you put the bloody straws in a glass and not your apron? I'm just getting madder every word I write here--\n\nDon't get mad at customers for being customers. You need to either change your method of straw distribution or get a new career."
b'Hah we get something similar at work. I\xe2\x80\x99ll be taking food to a table and I\xe2\x80\x99ll hand the first person I give the meal to Will start demanding sauces and various other items they\xe2\x80\x99ve ordered. Always respond with the \xe2\x80\x9ccan I finish handing out the rest of the food I\xe2\x80\x99m carrying before I jump to your demands?\xe2\x80\x9d Usually get a sheepish look and they go quiet. Often there\xe2\x80\x99s actually a giggle from the rest at the table about the friend being called out on there manners. '
b"I don't understand needing straws and I hate people who insist on them. Use your fuckin mouth like you have your whole life, on glasses, with liquid."
b'ahhh so it\'s an environmental thing. At the place I work we aren\'t allowed to give straws out if it\'s an iced tea or water but I thought that was just because they were being cheap asses. I always felt stupid because everyone else at the table would be like "Hey she got a straw, where\'s my straw??!" Fuck corporate I\'m giving a straw to everyone lol'
b'It\xe2\x80\x99s so aggravating to me that I want to just stop and throw the entire tray of drinks behind me and grab a straw. LET ME STOP WHAT IM DOING COMPLETELY, SO YOU CAN GET YOUR DAMN STRAW'
b'Literally 9/10 too, I give them straws by default, like you said after the drinks are on the table. It\xe2\x80\x99s only when I\xe2\x80\x99m not busy I give the spiel about the straws.'
b'If you ask when taking the drink order, you could avoid this I the future.'
b'So maybe ask before you set the drinks down,\n\n"Would anyone like a straw? You you and you? Sure, no problem, let me get these handed out"  \n\n\nBoom, problem solved. This just seems like you\'re venting about a problem and not thinking of ways to preventively solve it before it happens.'
b'The whole "straws are bad" movement is stupid. You guys realize the number of sea turtles that die each year from straw waste WAS MADE UP by a 6th grader???? Seriously, plastic in general getting into the oceans IS a big issue but straws are not the biggest concern. Plastic pellets used to form new plastic items are a much bigger nuisance because animals eat them thinking they\'re fish eggs. That said, I have my own metal straws I use because I prefer to use straws so drinks don\'t hurt my teeth. But if I forget them, I\'ll request a straw. Super rude to ask before you\'re even done handing out the drinks.'
b'This week I actually just made a lady wait for her stupid spoon. She was a vegetarian and it was so busy we barely had time to clear tables (and OF COURSE you get those people who want to sit at the damn dirty tables, stopping you to clean it for them)-- I didn\'t have time to go looking for that ONE small spoon we have available in the entire restaurant. I don\'t know why the owners don\'t get more small kid-friendly spoons. I really suspect that people make off with them all the time, so management just decided to stop buying them. \n\nSo yeah, I hadn\'t seen the last of the small spoons in days and tried telling her that. She was like, "no you have a small one." Yeah, just told you about that small one going AWOL. So I was like, Ok I\'ll go have a look. Let her wait while I rushed by delivering more plates to people before scouring the kitchen again for the spoon I knew wasn\'t there. Went back and told her it was gone, she was like, "Oh its OK."  Is it???? Is it, you finicky vegetarian?? (She had asked for something else before that, can\'t remember what)   Because it wasn\'t earlier!!!! '
b'From another perspective....\nGoing out to eat is a fun carefree break from the stress of life. It becomes disappointing when the event starts with a passive aggressive guilt trip about how we are all trying to save the environment here but if you want to be stupid here is a straw for ya. I could answer back im just trying to avoid the germs you put on my cup when you brought it to me by simply using a straw or I could watch you rewash ths cup and sanitize your hands so i wont feel the need for the straw to begin with... But thats crazy and now its just no fun to eat out anymore. '
b'I hate the straw movement literally can not give 2 everliving fucks about the seaturtles.\n\nThere are a thousand more things we could do for the environment that would have a greater effect than banning plastic straws.\n\nThat being said I dont want to have to ask you for a straw I just want one.\n\nIt may not be a popular opinion but fuck all the california commies that propogated that bullshit movement.'
b"I know that this is a place to vent, and as a server for 10plus years I have to say. That op needs to learn they're place. It is Not your place to correct rude customers and be rude in return. I understand that our jobs get frustrating but being able to maintain a positive attitude is what separates the good from the greats. Your job is to SERVE and create a positive experience for every guest even the rude ones. Maybe I was just trained by the best of the best so that's why I think this way but it's easy for customers to forget about courtesy when they've been at work all day and want to relax after words. I guess at the end of the day it comes down to how much do you value your job. "
b'A few years ago I was working two jobs and averaging around 60-70 hours a week. One of my regular restaurant customers saw me at my other job. He asked me if I had quit serving and I laughed and said "Nope. Gotta hustle to make the bills. DH is out of work. Know anyone looking for a farm boss?" He laughed and said no. A few days later he came in the restaurant and told me it was his last week there. He was a contractor who worked at a site for 13 weeks then moved wherever the company told him to go. I told him I was going to miss seeing him and good luck. He ate his regular $15 dinner and left 3 $100s on the table with a note wishing me good luck. '
b'We do it, but the amount is broken down into percentages, with the wait staff getting the biggest cut.'
b'I\xe2\x80\x99ve worked fine dining where you got your tips on your check. All tips were split evenly  between servers for the night with a percentage set aside for support staff '
b'"I\'ll kill a turtle"? Really? What an idiot. I bet she thought she sounded so bad-ass. That is the second time I\'ve about heard somebody making a smart-ass comment about killing turtles. You should have embarrassed her and said "By the way you got it wrong... it\'s six pack drink rings, fishing line and fishing nets that are mainly choking marine life, not straws, but good try, I guess" but then again I guess be prepared for no tip or get fired.'
b'> "I\'ll kill a turtle."\n\n"You\'re welcome. But you\'ll have to eat it after killing it, too."'
b'I hate these kinds of people. Sometimes when we have parties who don\xe2\x80\x99t know their totals, we set for how many they think and then only a few show up. But I always put down straws and bev naps for every potential guest just to be prepared/nice. And some people lash out over laying unnecessary straws on the table. Like, okay then. Drink out of the side of your cup. Whatever. I don\xe2\x80\x99t care that much. '
b'This is normal.  Look up food advertising. They use mashed potatoes for ice cream and motor oil for syrup. \n\nThe only guests who will care are the nitpickers looking for any excuse to get a free meal.'
b'Do you not have managers? Bartender slacking off early in the shift sucks, but it happens. Bartender leaving at 8:30 should never happen without the approval of a manager. Same with getting a table transferred to you. Managers are there to be the bad guys and tell people no. \n\nI enjoyed bartending more than serving. The fast pace plus the difference in money made me a happy camper. To each their own. Give it a little time. It might grow on you. '
b'You don\'t seem to hate bartending.  You hate the way you\'re getting screwed over by your CO-WORKERS, not superiors, not managers, but co-workers.  Tell them NO.  "You can go when we\'re caught up on the dishes and other side work."   " I\'m busy, I can\'t take your tables, either stay or give them to someone else".  \n\nStop letting people take advantage of you.  Bartending is a blast!   it\'s a lot easier on the body than serving, and much better tips!  Don\'t let bad co-workers take the fun out of it!'
b'We have two bartenders who are managers. This happens often. \n\nI can\xe2\x80\x99t train because I don\xe2\x80\x99t...do unnecessarily phallic things beneath the bar to earn the right to be there. So I serve. \n\nBut they literally will disappear to smoke and shit at like 8pm on a Friday during dinner rush with 20 drinks to pour or make and come back and yell at us for being incompetent because their job is stressful. \n\nGood luck!! I\xe2\x80\x99d bring it to mgmt attention if they try to hang you out to dry again. Just remember that the more time they slack off on and give up is time that you can make more $. '
b"You'll have to forgive me, because I'm neither a server or bartender. So I might not understand some things. But one thing is coming across very, very clearly. You need to stand up for yourself. Tell everyone, and I do mean EVERYONE, that you are only doing YOUR sidework/cutwork. You aren't going to do other people's work, unless they are willing to pay you for doing that work. And you set the rates that you feel is worth the extra work.\n\nTell the managers that bartend that you can't do the work, without being properly trained. You need them to be there working with you, and you need just as much time for breaks as they take themselves. If they take a ten minute break, then you can hand them a towel, and tell them what the next drink is, and walk out for a break of your own.\n\nAnd honestly, you need to document what's happening to you. You need to be able to say what time it is when your co-workers are doing whatever it is that affects you. What they are doing, what time they are doing it, what time it stops affecting you (this relates to breaks and such), and what you have to do to keep from being overwhelmed. Or... just how overwhelmed you are due to their actions.\n\nNow, of coarse, I don't know if any of this will help you in any way. But you might find that it does help. Maybe they are treating you like this because they think they can get away with it. If you stand up for yourself, then you are letting them know that you are confident in yourself. You can also be sending out feelers on potential job opportunities at the same time.\n\nI'm hoping that things improve for you. Maybe keep us updated, because you appear to have pride in yourself. Don't let them treat you like you are a dishrag, you (nobody, actually) deserves that kind of treatment."
b'Try not to dislocate your shoulder while patting your back that hard. Dealing with people and coming out in a positive light is part of almost every job.'
b'I find having employees is harder than serving. There are so many aspects of leadership that it is impossible to master them all, from inspiring to teaching, creating The work athmosphere, keeping all communication channels clear, hunting down discontempt before it settles and festers.\nBeing a server definitly have a lower skill ceiling. Just abit regrettable that so many leaders get stick in routines and, what sometimes to me seems like simply walking around in circles. '
b'I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s a stretch. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been in hospitality for years, and have picked up many nuances along the way that do wonders for your tips.\n\nOne of the best servers I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever seen who trained me at my current restaurant, taught me some amazing things:\n\n1. He has like 20 pens on his apron, all different colors or different shades of the same color, from the same brand (Zebra I think). I thought it was stupid. I\xe2\x80\x99ve always used mismatched pens without caps and it looks horrible. Turns out, In watching him interact with tables, every single damn table comments on those pens and loves them.\n\nWhen people pay with card, he matches the pen to their card and leaves it with them. 9 times out of 10 they leave a note saying or tell him that they loved how he matched the color of the card with the pen.\n\n2. There is an art to running cards for multiple checks at one table. I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen him do 12 separate checks at once. I used to select the first tab, run the card, put it in a presenter and then set it aside. I would do the same thing for the remaining checks. \n\nHis way, he will select the first tab, run it and put the card face down on top of the itemized receipt. He will proceed to do that for each of the cards without even touching the merchant copies yet. Once they\xe2\x80\x99ve all been ran and flipped face down, he picks up the pile, turns them around, and then begins to rip off the merchant and customer copies combining it with the itemized receipt, card and pen, all in order. He then places them on a tray clockwise starting from the tab at seat 1, all the way around until he\xe2\x80\x99s got them all loaded up. Then he delivers them back in order, without having to ask who is who. \n\nReally is like watching an artist. I\xe2\x80\x99ve learned a lot from that dude, and I truly think it\xe2\x80\x99s increased my tip totals too.'
b'I\xe2\x80\x99ve literally seen people sit at a dirty table next to a clean table and then move the glassware left on their table onto the clean table instead of just sitting there from the beginning '
b"This reminds me of my fast food days. Coming clear across the dining room to yell at me to clean a table, passing 10 clean ones. A few times even acting like it's my fault another customer is now sitting there, also demanding the same thing, looking like they now want to argue witu each other. I took to simply telling them to choose clean tables 'for safety reasons'. "
b"I've noticed this, too. One time, a family sat down at a table WHILE I was cleaning it. Customers will forego any clean table for a dirty one so long as it's a booth."
b'My first ever serving shift was at a brunch buffet just like you described. I had been bartending there but it was a service bar so I never really had to talk to people and definitely never had to carry a cocktail tray.  On my third table I spilled two mimosas in the center of the table. Didn\'t really get on anyone but got champagne and glass in a couple people\'s food (lucky it was a buffet). I was so mortified. They were not cool with it. I tried to tell my manager I didn\'t want to be a server anymore but she wouldn\'t let me haha. She just told me to shut up and come back when I did something actually embarrassing. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt\'s funny because I\'ve been serving for years now and I\'m still a huge clutz. I work fine dining now which is supposed to be formal  and the other day I was in a hurry bringing a check on a wooden board to a table. I reached my hand out to place it on the end of the table and just ended up sort of flinging it forward on to their table accidentally, shattering an empty wine glass. They both just stared at me in shock as I was frozen there with my hand out. I just lowered it and said "Your check has arrived." In a really weird robot voice (I was panicking okay). They died laughing. '
b'I did a similar thing on my first ever solo shift. I spilled half a bottle of Shiner on a veteran and his service dog when I tripped on my own two feet. He was super chill about it, thank God, and refused any discount or comp on his meal. Not a heartening start to my foray into the service industry, but it turned out ok.'
b'I spilt a Bloody Mary on a lady wearing a white blouse during brunch before, the worst part is it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t even my table and I hated that I could\xe2\x80\x99ve affected someone else\xe2\x80\x99s tips. \n\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s the industry though, spilling drinks and breaking glass '
b"My favorite response: 'If you want to eat for free, go to Costco. I hear they have free samples all day.'"
b'Here\xe2\x80\x99s the thing, barring jobs like engineer and physician there are always going to be people shitting on your job. Even then I\xe2\x80\x99m sure someone would find something to put you down with. Hell you could be a lawyer and someone could tell you your job makes you a crook. If you enjoy working in the restaurant industry that\xe2\x80\x99s great. You\xe2\x80\x99re a server now, but build the right skills and you could get into management or ownership eventually if that\xe2\x80\x99s what you want. Or you could study the culinary arts and become a chef. There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing undignified about working in the service industry. It builds good customer service skills that can easily transfer over to other jobs if you change your mind later. Keep up what you like to do, just definitely do keep on studying too. There\xe2\x80\x99s always something you could learn to get yourself ahead in life, so never close the door on higher education. '
b'Also not a server, but am a parent. :) We always tell our kid that the world needs brain surgeons AND baristas, and the most important thing is that he is happy, kind and able to support himself. It sounds like you\xe2\x80\x99re all those things so please consider this an official parental stamp of approval. '
b'I haven\'t had anyone tell me that my job isn\'t a real job yet, but then again I don\'t talk to people outside of work in the first place. But if anyone told me that, I\'d say, "if it pays the bill and keeps a roof over my head it\'s as real a job as it gets." '
b'At our Xmas party, one of leaders had a boyfriend who on the way out(they left early), literally said "I have to get to sleep and go to my real job in the am". Now she was livid and knows she makes a lot more than him, so naturally, I do to. My reaction is to take my leads to a brunch day at a fancier place one Saturday and keep mentioning to him how nice it is to be able to afford to take my leaders out for a 30 dollar a head brunch as a reward... she doesn\'t let him love it down. \n\nEdit before you all think I\'m loaded;\n\nI fucked myself over that check to wave my dick in his face. Like ramen and no cigarettes for a while check. Didn\'t pay off my car payment that month either. All for the sake of screw this guy.'
b"What's a real job? Every job should be considered a real job.\nIf you aren't abusing your body being on your feet all day running food and drinks, or building buildings, then you are wracking your mind trying to get paperwork or coding or assignments done.\nI don't understand peoples mentality. "
b"I majored in Parks, Rec, and Tourism, (emphasizing Commercial Rec Management) but Hospitality management is one of the emphases. It's totally a legitimate career path, and the courses are designed to teach you how to manage places like restaurants, hotels, etc. If that's what you want to do, go for it!"
b'"So, are you in college?"  and the ever popular "Are you an actress?"\n\nSo patronizing.  But if you lie and say you are, you get a better tip.  Whatever.\n'
b"I'd like to add that nursing pays less, in some instances, so I'll take a shorter shift, to make more money.  Fuck, I got into the wrong field."
b'Isn\xe2\x80\x99t there special training for those really high end serving jobs? I think that\xe2\x80\x99s a respectable career and that definitely pays well. If you like it, then continue it '
b'I\'m a physician, but was a bartender and server to help put myself through med school. I LOVED it, and made pretty good money doing it (anywhere from $20-50/hr depending on the night). Without those jobs, I can\'t imagine how astronomically high my student loans would (still) be at this point.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut most importantly, working in the food industry absolutely made me a better physician. I learned to how to deal respectfully but firmly with cranky/difficult/entitled people, and also learned how it feels to be occasionally treated as "the help" or as lesser person simply because of my job or assumptions about my financial/social status, a sentiment I never want to pass on to anyone else. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor the right person with the right attitude, you can absolutely thrive in the food industry. A lot of the people telling you to turn back are likely holding on to that same prejudice that it\'s a "toxic" or "lesser" industry, which is an unfortunately prevalent if grossly misguided position. \n\n  \nYou do you, if you love it you will succeed and do well. '
b'Why on earth would any reasonable server get upset about being asked for recommendations?  If I\'m eating at a new restaurant I\'ll often ask the server "If you got a free meal right now off the menu, what would you eat?"  They know the menu better than I do, they know what\'s good.'
b'No I never mind! We have a decent sized menu with appetizers, burgers, sandwiches, salads, a few entrees, and some pasta choices. Your standard bar/restaurant menu. We truly have great food, but there\xe2\x80\x99s are a few things I don\xe2\x80\x99t recommend. They\xe2\x80\x99re good just not worth getting. If people give me two options I always give an honest opinion since I want my guests to be happy. '
b'I love to suggest what I actually think is worth paying for. If you don\xe2\x80\x99t like LTOP, I\xe2\x80\x99m not gonna recommend a loaded down burger with cheese curds, onion rings, fried onions, etc. etc. I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna try to save you some money (and tell you so!) by suggesting a plain $10 burger with some fries. \n\nIf you aren\xe2\x80\x99t picky, I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna recommend something expensive and an upgraded side to go with it. '
b'I work at a family owned pizza place, and personally I don\'t mind it as long as the customer knows their own tastes and isn\'t just asking "what\'s a good pizza to order". '
b"That's sort of why I am there.     \n\nI will generally go with the dish that has the most positive comments on a steady basis."
b'Nope, I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind. What it\xe2\x80\x99s as good is when people just don\xe2\x80\x99t even look at the menu and ask what my favorite thing is. Then I feel really put on the spot and pressured to get it right for them. \n\nAlso, if I don\xe2\x80\x99t like either thing you\xe2\x80\x99ve asked about, I\xe2\x80\x99m just gonna say the higher priced one '
b'I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind that, but when someone is like \xe2\x80\x9cwhat\xe2\x80\x99s good on the menu\xe2\x80\x9d and hasn\xe2\x80\x99t even opened it, I\xe2\x80\x99ll politely ask if they see anything they like on the menu or have questions about it. I\xe2\x80\x99m not about to break down all 2million items on our menu while my other 5 tables stare at me for an extra 5$.'
b'I\'m vegetarian. That means I don\'t know what 99% of the menu at my restaurant tastes like so when customers ask me such questions I feel ingenuine just pointing to the option I see people order more. And when they ask if something is good, the only thing I can say in response is "yeah, it\'s good, lots of people order it and like it" because I can\'t give proper details on what it actually tastes like. '
b'First time posting a comment on this sub. As I do understand the frustration from your coworker and have worked at a shitty sports bar myself, I still understand getting sent home for not wearing non-slip shoes. That shit can become super dangerous. I once was able to get past the check of shoes when I forgot mine once and I almost slipped and fell multiple times during that shift. Again I totally understand from a stand point of just being fed up with a place and that\xe2\x80\x99s the last straw.  But there\xe2\x80\x99s a reason for wearing those things. '
b'He should have his non slip shoes while working, always. It\'s really not the restaurants problem he forgot them, but it is their problem of he falls and hurts himself or someone else in the process.  Furthermore, both managers should be on the same page regarding policy, otherwise it creates a "dad said I could do it\'s environment". I worked as a server for ten years, and their is a huge difference between wearing/not wearing non slip shoes. I would have most likely cracked my head open, or dropped a heavy try on a baby. '
b'I think the response of your coworker was kind of childish. I understand how frustrating that would be to lose those hours but if he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t wearing the proper shoes and slipped and got hurt - the restaurant\xe2\x80\x99s insurance wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t cover that. That\xe2\x80\x99s a huge liability issue. People think that it\xe2\x80\x99ll never happen but I\xe2\x80\x99ve worked with people who have gotten seriously hurt because of this. \n\nI think the second manager was just doing their job. It\xe2\x80\x99s unfortunate that the two managers weren\xe2\x80\x99t on the same page here with being consistent or couldn\xe2\x80\x99t offer another solution such as helping him swap shifts with someone so he didn\xe2\x80\x99t have to just lose the hours. But knowingly allowing for your coworker to work unsafely could put both of their jobs in jeopardy. \n\nWith all of that being said, I am sorry to hear you lost your work buddy. That really does suck. '
b'Man he must have really hated it there if that was his last straw. Sounds like the manager was just doing his job, cuz that\xe2\x80\x99s a very petty reason to quit your job. Also, he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been that bad off if he is willing to quit a job on the spot with no other job lined up. That sounds like a pretty dumb thing to do. \n\nWhen I used to work at an Outback Steakhouse I had my extra pair of old non slips in my trunk. Just in case I did forget for some reason. '
b"I read a lot of comments about him being a liability to the restaurant etc...what about him not having the shoes being a liability to HIMSELF? He slips, falls, gets hurt, fucks up something really badly (anything can happen), he's long term fucked. \n\nWhen it comes to health and stuff I go full Batfleck. If there's even 1% of something happening we must treat it like an absolute certainty."
b"sometimes you get that one manager who turned his badge upside down and sat on the pin... and it turned them into an asshole for life. Evidently, since he'd already been job hunting and found something else, he'd gotten tired of something that goes on there - or found someplace that gives better hours, so he won't end up homeless."
b'Tell her to bring her own quinoa next time. '
b'Dear Lord. Ok, for future reference, you\'re not playing this game. The correct response is "I\'m sorry you feel insecure with your relationship, but honesty is the best way to address this and I\'m not comfortable behaving in a dishonest way."'
b'She *wants* him to cheat, because she wants a divorce, and she wants it to be his fault so she can walk off with all his stuff. 100% guarantee.'
b"In my experience, the first person to cheat becomes stupid paranoid about their partners and doubts them at every turn. It's happened to me more times than I'd like to admit (I was the one cheated on). After the guilt set in with them, they'd go through my phone, my messages, etc. trying to find proof I cheated. I was faithful. They also tried to set me up like this a few times. "
b'The first thing your mind went to was indeed correct. It is an abusive relationship, only she is the abusive one.'
b'Good gosh. That\xe2\x80\x99s outright mental and emotional abuse right there. I can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine being that paranoid and insecure to ask a random HS girl to hit on her husband and see how he reacts '
b'"If the guy is cheating, we should help her out."\n\n14-year industry vet here. Our customers\' personal lives is not ours or anyone\'s business, whether they be one timers or regulars. \n\nAppreciate you getting a super involved, but you should\'ve ignored it from the get go, and she should\'ve let it be.'
b"That woman essentially asked you to prostitute yourself which is just horrible. \nI expected your supervisor to just tell the man what you'd been asked to do, not go along with the manipulation! \nI hope he left that woman asap\n\nWhat bizarre, vile behaviour "
b'He sounds like he deserves better.'
b'She is a crazy person. She has an extreme amount of insecurity and is going to end up divorced. Poor guy'
b"If the overheard part of the conversation is to be believed, then pretty much anything the husband does will never convince the wife that he is not cheating.  At best she drives him away until he finally files for divorce.  At worst she poisons him slowly or shoots him in his sleep, convinced that will finally stop his cheating.\n\nMore than likely tho, the overheard part of the conversation is complete BS, and she (they) are out shopping for a 3rd for the night.  Probably they take turns picking out someone they think will please the other, and come up with some kind of ploy to start interacting with them.  Obviously she thought you were a good choice, and your super wasn't.  After he cancels the order and they leave, they go to another place and try it again."
b"I don't think you should do that that even if he was. Like to me that's a big no no, and look what happened here. If that were me even though my mind's always in the gutter id be very uncomfortable being a young adult male. "
b'Why on earth would a supervisor get involved.   She ensured they lost the $$ and future business not to mention another nail in their difficult marriage. '
b'\\> \xe2\x80\x9cWell, maybe if you\xe2\x80\x99d just admit to cheating I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have to do a sting operation of my own "\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis made me lol irl, the sting operation part, well played OP'
b'I came close to taking a job at a senior community. Good thing I didn\xe2\x80\x99t. Some of those old people didn\xe2\x80\x99t learn anything in their 60+ years. \nSorry you had to go through that! '
b'Nice thing about working in a senior home is knowing they\xe2\x80\x99re all going to die pretty soon.'
b"This is so horrifying I don't even know where to begin. I understand that 99% of people are good but this is taking a risk that I would never take. Sending your kids into a public restroom, alone, and basically instructing them to expose themselves to the nicest looking stranger because you are too lazy to put down your chardonnay for five minutes? \n\nThose poor girls. Thanks OP for helping and also for confronting the parents, whatever little good it did. Maybe if enough people do it, it will dawn on them that it's not normal behavior."
b"Not only making someone else take care of your children,  but a stranger, you haven't even seen?!  And PLEASE TOUCH WHERE NO ONE SHOULD BE TOUCHING?!?!  (Except of course guardian)  It sickens me that she hopped down and presented her butt, I mean really?!  That's not how to wipe a 3y/o."
b'That is horrible, horrible parenting & human being - the \xe2\x80\x9cnot going into the bathroom with your kids\xe2\x80\x9d part & manipulating others to do your \xe2\x80\x9cdirty\xe2\x80\x9d work.  Makes me stabby.  #momof3girls'
b"Oh hell the fuck no. I would never tell my kid to ask for help wiping from some stranger. No matter how nice looking they are. That is begging for a lawsuit. Honestly, if that were me in your shoes, I'd tell them that I would go find their parents and leave as fast as possible. I'm glad it turned out for you. It blows my mind that this even happened. "
b'As a parent, this is terrifying. As a server, also terrifying.\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s a dangerous world for children, and a dangerous world for any adult who tries to \xe2\x80\x9chelp\xe2\x80\x9d anymore.\n\nIf they ever come back, you say \xe2\x80\x9clet me get your mom\xe2\x80\x9d and march right out of the bathroom and tell the woman (or dad) that their children, who they\xe2\x80\x99ve fucking created, need their assistance. I hate these parents for telling their children to do this, and also for putting many people in a shady situation because they can\xe2\x80\x99t take 5 minutes out of their day to help the little humans they\xe2\x80\x99re raising. It made my blood boil for you and those girls reading this.'
b"No, no, no, no, no, no, no.\n\nThis is so bad.\n\nI realize you were caught in an awkward situation, but please never do that again.\n\nYou are putting yourself at so much risk.\n\nOur kids are grown now, but when they were younger, my husband absolutely refused to home alone with the children if they had friends over and he never, ever drove a babysitter home.\n\nEither both of us were home or kids didn't come inside the house (yard was fine).  And I always took the babysitter home.\n\nIt's not that we thought anyone would actually accuse him of anything, it's that it was just too big a risk to take.\n\nThat was in the '90s and there was a slew of daycare abuse stories on the news.  Many of them turned out to be false accusations but people's live's were ruined anyway."
b'Having been a closing server or bartender more nights than not in the last two years I\xe2\x80\x99d say you\xe2\x80\x99re totally in the clear here man. Nobody really gives a f*ck if it\xe2\x80\x99s before the flattop/broiler/fryer get turned off and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t keep it from getting turned off at the set time. Especially if it\xe2\x80\x99s low key shit and not complex entrees. \n\n2 things though: Frankly, I\xe2\x80\x99ve always felt torn about getting big tips on to-gos. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t actually provide you any service throughout this meal - that you\xe2\x80\x99re not even going to eat here, that I\xe2\x80\x99m not even going to have to clean up etc. etc. - therefore, I\xe2\x80\x99m often left feeling like I\xe2\x80\x99m on the receiving end of some guilty conscience charity or a \xe2\x80\x9cwoe to the service industry worker, tip them well so they don\xe2\x80\x99t have to eat at the soup kitchen\xe2\x80\x9d. Not saying it\xe2\x80\x99s not a welcome addition to the nights tip haul, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe I provided service that improved your meal by 20%+ by cashing you out and handing you your food. Which brings me to my second point, the kitchen is really doing 85% of the work in getting your order ready for you. Find out if the restaurant tip shares any with the kitchen - if they do by all means keep tipping well - those cooks will make sure you\xe2\x80\x99re getting the best quality they can provide when they know it\xe2\x80\x99s being graciously appreciated. But if they don\xe2\x80\x99t tip share with the cooks it\xe2\x80\x99s not a bad idea to go above and beyond to show those cooks some love. At the spot I\xe2\x80\x99m currently working at, customers are more than welcome to buy the kitchen a round of beer. Point is, try and do something for the cooks - it\xe2\x80\x99s no fun to hear how the meal you just whipped up instead of finishing your cleaning so you can leave, earned somebody else a fat tip just cause they walked it from the window to the register. \n\nTL;DR \nOrdering to go that\xe2\x80\x99ll be finished before close is totally fine. Don\xe2\x80\x99t feel like tipping 20% on to-gos is necessary, the server didn\xe2\x80\x99t really do shit. Try and find a way to hook up the cooks though if you can. '
b'I have definitely been there. When I was in that situation I took random work outside the service industry until I found what I was looking for.  I would check Craigslist and get shitty random jobs, they even have a section for \xe2\x80\x9cgigs\xe2\x80\x9d that are odd jobs like helping people move, and other crap like that.  It\xe2\x80\x99s not the tits, but it can get you by in a pinch.  I really hope all the best for you.  '
b'Good for you for leaving. At the last serving job I had, the expo was also the food runner, so we had to make sure everything went out perfectly because we were the ones presenting the meal. As such, servers were required to tip out the food runner because we still were earning less than kitchen wages. \n\nThere was one server (let\xe2\x80\x99s call her Meg) who would regularly give like a dollar or two to the food runner and would always complain that she didn\xe2\x80\x99t like tipping out. Before long, Meg learned that she could just finish her cut work and quietly leave before I went around asking for the tip out.\n\nSo on a really busy night when I was the expo/food runner, I made it a point to not run a single thing for Meg\xe2\x80\x99s tables. When her food was up, I would push it to the side, nothing expo\xe2\x80\x99d on it. When she came to the kitchen and saw what I was doing, she got all pissy and demanded I run her food. I swiftly replied: \xe2\x80\x9cNope. You can do it. That\xe2\x80\x99s why they pay you the big bucks, right?\xe2\x80\x9d And when she just stared back with this sour look on her face, I added: \xe2\x80\x9cGo fuck yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d Easily the most confrontational, yet most satisfying, work dispute I\xe2\x80\x99ve had with someone. She ended up quitting not long after. '
b"Good for you for leaving. I have only walked out of one place in my life and it was totally worth it too.\n\n\nHowever, (I still agree with what you did just want to help give some perspective) when there is only one person bussing/hosting/running food etc. The net effect feels watered down by being done by 1 person. You can only do so much and I'm guesing the servers felt the difference in the lowered number of support staff. \n\n\nTo be clear, it was very wrong of them to not give you a tip out, but from their perspective they are paying a normal tipout rate for way less man power. For all the good work you do, you can't be two places at once. You were young and they tried to take advantage of you, which was wrong.\n\n\nWhen you get older and used to people's bullshit you will get better at staying calm while remaining assertive. There was definitely room for negotiating, but something tells me if none of the servers were intent to tip you they were either colluding, all assholes or there's a side to this story we're missing.\n\n\nAnyway I'm glad you told your story. Lesson here is not to let your manager get away before you get tipped out."
b"This is why at the restaurant I work at the managers always handle checkouts. They always make sure that we give the proper tip out. However, we don't actually tip out the kitchen or hostess, we only tip out the bar. Personally I find it weird when bar already gets tips, but the kitchen staff make a lot more and our hostess is one of the manager's 17 year old daughter. But, I digress. It's not my business to run. "
b'Is it just me or doesn\'t "bust ass" mean let a juicy fart rip? I am pretty sure OP was "hauling ass" or perhaps "busting my ass." I think you need the "my" in there.'
b'Tell the manager you\xe2\x80\x99ll come back if they tip you properly for that day. Have her give you the money. Then don\xe2\x80\x99t show up\n\nr/pettyrevenge'
b"Get to work a few minutes early and make sure the Ziosks in your section are all in working order before your shift. Check the POS for 86ed items or ask a manager what is 86ed. If the sugar caddies haven't been filled the shift before yours, fills those as well. \n\nIt's overwhelming to see three tables you have to greet, but it makes getting drinks and salad/soup/breadstick setups out a lot easier. I greet each table and get drink and appetizer orders from all of them at once. (Use the Ziosks to order any bar drinks, appetizers, or kid's meals!) After everyone has their drinks, I take each table's entree order. If anyone else has sat down in the cafe during this time, put coasters down and tell them you'll be with them shortly. \n\nPut each table's order in the POS then get their setups. (Check for appetizers that may have come up and bring extra breadsticks with you for the tables that were waiting!) Give the extra breadsticks to the tables you haven't got drinks for yet then pass out everyone else's salad/soup/breadstick setups. Ask ahead of time if they're going to want another salad or more bread right away. \n\nGreet the tables that have been waiting and get their drink and appetizer orders. While you're getting the new tables' drinks, grab any drink refills for your first set of tables. Take your second set of tables' entree orders and put them in the POS. While you're in the kitchen getting their setups, get the salad/soup/breadstick refills for your first round of tables. (Check for appetizers while you're back there!) \n\nRun the setups and refills out, then check on everyone at once. Make sure no one needs any drink and/or salad/soup/breadstick refills. \n\nOnce all of your tables have something to eat, everything after that is maintenance. All of these tips apply when you're in a regular section as well. I find that when I'm in the cafe, most people are understanding when I tell them I'm the only server in there. Don't be afraid to ask your coworkers and managers for help if you fall behind. Good luck!"
b'I hate nosy assed people. \n\nDeadpan reply to these bozos, \xe2\x80\x9caround 2010 pounds, why?\xe2\x80\x9d and give them the blank face. '
b'"Oh I\'m sorry, "how much do you weigh" is not on our menu. Can I offer you an ice-cold "fuck off"?"'
b'I get asked this too much. I\'m very skinny, I know I\'m skinny, I do not like how skinny I am. I can however do without "What are you 80 pounds?" questions I get all of the time. \n\nCertainly nobody would go to somebody who is morbidly obese and go "What are you 500 pounds?". \n\nSorry if that sounds like a stupid argument, but I\'m insecure about being underweight and I think it\'s incredibly rude. Although this guy just sounds more creepy than rude lol. '
b'First, there are three questions you should consider:\n\n1. You\xe2\x80\x99re making good money here. Are you able to make the same money elsewhere?\n\n2.  Does the owner have your back?\n\n3. What is the primary source of those feelings of humiliation? Because your coworkers treated you badly? Or because the customers stood up for you? I suspect it is the second. If so, think about that hard because it means that you think it is better to be mistreated than have other people help you. \n\nSecond, I understand you dislike confrontation, but you can\xe2\x80\x99t bury your head in the sand like that. You cannot hope that problems and toxic coworkers will just go away. Here, you have your customers backing you up. Since you did not want to stand up for yourself, your customers stood up for you, and gave you a very nice tip. However, you seem anguished/angry at the customers for voicing their displeasure about the bad treatment they witnessed and making a big fuss about it; You also seem unhappy that they brought the problem to everyone\xe2\x80\x99s attention. \n\nWhat you don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to realize is that some problems don\xe2\x80\x99t go away even if you ignore them. Instead, they fester and ooze pus and blood. You seem to think that the situation will become worse because the customers brought attention to the issue. However, even if they were not there, the situation was becoming worse. At first, they were snooty. Then they asked you to do their side work. Then they...etc.  \n\nFinally, this situation is not unique to one workplace. Many people are like that, and many people take advantage of people. Stand up for yourself. \n\n'
b'Great that your last table stood up for you... And kudos for not letting the clique grind you down. Now please, please tell us what happened next! '
b"Next time say something to your coworkers about their bullshit. I've had multiple altercations with co workers over the years for similar things. Although I didn't handle it the right way but it got my point across. I never had issues with those people ever again and they were always nice even though they probably talk shit behind my back.\n\nWith people like this you have to put your foot down otherwise this crap will continue. That is the only way that problem stops. Dealing with shit like that where it takes 5+ minutes for a drink is taking money out your pocket.\n\nThat's the way I always look at it.\n\nI know its easier said than done but you shouldn't feel humiliated. It should be your coworkers who should feel that way because they were clearly in the wrong. You were doing your job and they wanted to play games. You did nothing wrong."
b'This bothers me to no end. Feel for you OP and good for you for keeping your composure. Being a server is stressful! \nI had a serving job a few years ago and we had two dick head servers that would NEVER do their side work. Manager implements a rule that whoever is closing has to cover the side work of whoever didn\xe2\x80\x99t do theirs. Of course, I usually had the latest shift possible, so, that\xe2\x80\x99s me. I tell the manager I\xe2\x80\x99m not doing their shit. He says he\xe2\x80\x99ll start scheduling me less. I quit the next morning. Fuck lazy coworkers and fuck managers who don\xe2\x80\x99t manage '
b"I'm sorry but you have to give the glasses to the bartender? That's the dumbest shit I've ever heard. I'd jump ship and go find a better serving job somewhere else. If that's policy then I can't imagine what other asinine shit you have to put up with. "
b'You\xe2\x80\x99re a very non confrontational person but a simple terse \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m busy,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cI have my own side work to do,\xe2\x80\x9d is needed when these girls come around trying to order you about because THEY HAVE NO AUTHORITY OVER YOU. You don\xe2\x80\x99t have to tell them off since it\xe2\x80\x99s not in your nature but you do need to stop being a punching bag. Practice saying short direct phrases until you get comfortable saying them and follow through with whatever you say. Don\xe2\x80\x99t let them bully you into submission. These kinds of people will never like you but you can make them respect you.'
b"It sounds like the owner is decent at least.  So what are the possible outcomes of the meeting today?\n\n1. The 'manager' for the shift gets fired (and possibly the bartender as well).  This is most likely what I would do and what I think should be done.  This is the best case scenario for you but you do have to watch for others that may have liked that particular manager and had their back.  Although it doesn't really sound like they can bully you any more than they already are, they definitely aren't going to make your job any easier if they think it's your fault that person got fired.\n2. The owner talks to the manager involved and suspends them or gives them a warning.  This *may* temporarily stop this from happening again but by the sound of this 'manager' they will probably do whatever they can to make you quit.\n3. The owner hears their side of the story, whatever that may be, and you get punished or at least talked to.  This may happen depending on how much trust there is between this manager and the owner.  \n\nWhatever happens, I think quitting is the way to go.  Even if you have to take a little bit of a pay cut, not being surrounded by shitty people in a toxic environment can definitely make it worth it.  Of course, this is easy for me to say but I don't know if your financial (or some other) situation would allow it.   If it won't, start looking for another job now. \n\nIf you decide to stay, you need to stand up for yourself.  Stop helping your coworkers if they won't help you.  I hate to encourage this kind of pettiness but it is literally costing you money when they are treating you like shit and not helping you while you go out of your way to help them.  Take care of your shit and nothing else.  If someone asks you to do their job either say no or, if you're feeling vindictive, just say okay then don't do it.  Let them explain to the owner that the reason the work didn't get done is because they tried to pawn their shit off on someone else. \n\nAnd also, fuck that bartender.  No matter how you feel about your coworkers, you should never punish a customer as a result of those feelings.   The fact that the 'manager' let that happen tells me just how shitty he/she is."
b'I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if quitting is worth it but I do think you should give it a chance to see if anything changes after the meeting.'
b'Don\xe2\x80\x99t quit, you aren\xe2\x80\x99t a gazelle, you are better then that. The guys calling for you is a blessing. Let people help. Nothing here is your fault. You are actually so good that they felt the need to call a day after. They are also so shitty that they resonated with those guys a day later. They might be upset at you for a short time after but that\xe2\x80\x99s just misplaced anger because it\xe2\x80\x99s really on them. You have done everything perfect, do not quit that easy. '
b'I also faced similar treatment in my workplace and it just about drove me into the ground. I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if I can offer some words of advice based on my experience. When I encountered treatment much like what you\xe2\x80\x99re describing, I thought that if I held my head high and took the high road, that these catty co workers would either give up or come to their senses. This is a NORMAL and RATIONAL approach. That said, people who act like your (and my) co workers did are neither normal nor rational people. Truthfully, It\xe2\x80\x99s as if they felt my non-confrontational reaction gave them the green light to escalate the bullying behaviour, and it seems like your co workers are no different. Moving forward I have learned that, no, not everyone is going to like me. People become ESPECIALLY insecure around introverted women, as somehow they just assume you\xe2\x80\x99re being standoffish and they immediately go on the defence. That said, someone can dislike me all they like, but the second it escalates into behaviour that affects me in any way, I\xe2\x80\x99m damn well going to call them out. If that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work (which often it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t because, again, these people are neither normal nor rational) then I escalate the matter. I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry you ended up feeling humiliated. Damn right I hope the owner  rips them a new one though, and kudos to your customers for saying something.  Sadly, this likely won\xe2\x80\x99t be the last time co workers project their insecurities onto you, so I hope you can get in the habit of calling them right the fuck out. No one deserves this sort of treatment, super duper fuck that. '
b'Will you update after the meeting? I\xe2\x80\x99m dying to know how it gets handled. I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry to hear about their childish antics, and you really don\xe2\x80\x99t have to put up with it. Maybe it will be a good thing that it finally came to a head and you won\xe2\x80\x99t have to work with a bunch of Regina George\xe2\x80\x99s forever.\n\nAlso I\xe2\x80\x99d like to say that most of the commenters are correct, you will have to stand your ground. They will walk all over you forever until you stand up for yourself.'
b'You cannot go into work wanting people to like you, stand your ground dont be nice be respectful and do a good job. Work hard and continue to help others because karma will be on your side. If you wanna last in this industry put your foot down and be a B back to those Bs they are taking advantage of the fact you\'re the "quiet girl" ..people are weird AF.\n\nIf they fire you just laugh in their faces and say what u wanna say ..theres a million serving jobs out there '
b'Honey, those customers *are* doing you a favor. Along with the doing the owner a favor as well. \n\nAs a former business owner, you are the kind of employee every good manager, and every owner wants. A team full of yous is a dream! I would go over and above to keep people like you on my team. \n\nAs an introvert who has also had to deal with bullies\xe2\x80\x94keep your chin up. Focus on being the best employee you can be. Part of that is keeping management appraised of problems that affect the business\xe2\x80\x94coworkers refusing to do their jobs? A manager bogging you down with her side work when you\xe2\x80\x99re slammed, and not addressing issues occurring right in front of her face? Yes\xe2\x80\x94as you see, that behavior impacts customers, especially when the behavior is happening right in front of them and lowering their opinion of the business. Reporting problems is not snitching\xe2\x80\x94what\xe2\x80\x99s good for the business is good for you\xe2\x80\x94having crappy managers dealt with, and problem employees behavior addressed is a business problem. \n\nIn the end, focusing on the work, and being a good coworker and company employee is what got me on a project which got me a promotion\xe2\x80\x94most of my bullies got themselves fired because of their behavior, and the supervisor isn\xe2\x80\x99t going any higher\xe2\x80\x94they\xe2\x80\x99re stagnant where they are and that\xe2\x80\x99s not going to change. \n\nPeople standing up for you, and problems being pointed out is not a bad thing. That was a blessing\xe2\x80\x94outsider observation, so egregious it can\xe2\x80\x99t be dismissed as a disgruntled employee retaliating. You now have the higher ground, an advantage\xe2\x80\x94your narrative is Truth. '
b"I feel like you are me 15 years ago. I have always had a hard time with confrontation. I'm 35 years old now and still hate confrontation although I am much better at sticking up for others than I am myself. If someone does something to my children or family, I dont hesitate to let my inner beast out lol I just cannot always do the same for myself for some reason. I can clearly remember the few times in my life I have stood up for myself and it wasnt easy and took a lot to get me to that point. I was very proud of myself for doing so and still remember each of those times. \n\n\nMy best advice I can give you is to accept the help of others. If the owner is a good person, allow her to help you. Give it a chance and see if it gets better. People will walk all over those who they view as weaker than them. They know you wont stand up for yourself, so they will keep doing it. If you cant stand up for yourself, stand up for your customers and the owner, as it is her business that is being affected when they do stuff like this and she doesnt deserve that. Tell her if it keeps happening so she is able to protect her business. She isnt going to want to keep vile people who are harming her wallet. \n\n\nDont be upset with the customers for standing up for you. I'm glad there are people like them out there who cant stand to see others be mistreated and will speak up when they see it. I wish more people were like this. If your work experience gets worse because of this, go to the owner for help. Speak up for yourself and your customers in the moment as best you can. They will respect you more if you do so and wont see you as such an easy target. If the owner doesn't do anything and you are still miserable after trying everything, then give your two weeks notice directly to the owner and explain why you're doing so. My guess is she will try to convince you to stay and will promise to fix the issue for you.  Most owners wouldn't want bad employees to chase away their hardworking one's. Hopefully, she is able to out a stop to it. \n\n\nEverything in life is a learning experience. Hopefully, you can use this experience to grow as a person and strengthen your resolve to not allow others to walk all over you. There will be many times in life where you come in contact with people like this and it's important that you learn how to deal with them. I dealt with a crazy woman the other day and my kids are being bullied on the bus by some older kids. I realized that these crazy people I deal with out in public probably have kids and my poor kids have to learn how to deal with their kids. It's my job as their mom to give them the tools to deal with bullies and to step in and protect them when they need it. I need to be able to do so when necessary to protect my kids and I never want to be too scared to do that. "
b'I have to ask, what kind of restaurant has the server put a glass up to fill by the bartender? I\xe2\x80\x99ve bartended many places and have never seen this practice. First, why wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t the glasses be chilled for most draft beers; behind the bar? I know it\xe2\x80\x99s Guinness, so okay for a warm glass. Second, what kind of lazy ass bartender can\xe2\x80\x99t pull their own glass? Third, you only do your side work unless someone pays you to do theirs. '
b'Girl get outta there it\xe2\x80\x99s only serving so many other serving jobs. Don\xe2\x80\x99t stop quitting and getting a new job until you find the right one. '
b'Reading this there are a lot of good comments so I don\xe2\x80\x99t have much to add but **HUGS** I\xe2\x80\x99m so sorry that happened to you.\n\nReading it from an outside perspective it just sounds like they\xe2\x80\x99re all being petty and most likely jealous because you\xe2\x80\x99re a hard worker, get good tips and some people just can\xe2\x80\x99t handle others doing well or better then them and look for any little thing to pick on.'
b'I would love to hear an update! Let us know how everything goes, best of luck on your shift.'
b"I think you probably should look for another job. It sounds like you are a hard worker and a great server. There are places that will treat you with respect, and where you might even make friends. I work with an all female FOH staff and thankfully we all get along, whenever there's a troublemaker they don't last long. What your manager was doing was so unbelievably inappropriate. The bartender might have been being a bitch but it was the managers job to step in. Prove a point?? Why does she have the right to do that to you at the customers expense??? I'm happy they called, the owner needs to know."
b'What part was humiliating? That table standing up for you was amazing and they coworkers of yours were completely pathetic. I hope that they all get reprimanded. '
b"Those guys are right, you need to find a new job. Whenever I've been faced with a decision like this I always get worried that I won't be able to find a new job, the week of training will bog me down and I won't make my bills, etc. Without fail it has always worked out and I've had a new job within a few days at a nicer restaurant making more money and the training and everything else has never really even factored in. I wish you the best of luck!"
b"OP, you need to find another job.  And yes, there are lots of serving jobs out there as it's a high turn over industry.  Your co-workers are going to be really pissed after the meeting and treat you worse than ever.  They'll be affecting your tips and thus your wages.\n\nStart looking today.  Fill out apps online, call and ask for the manager, ask when the manager will be available.  Walk in and get a drink and talk to the bartender.  If the servers need help, they'll be happy to have another person on board.  Get something new lined up asap.  Don't be afraid; your current job is cliquey and you can do better.  "
b"I don't understand your humiliation. Your non confrontational attitude about the shitty people you work with made those customers wait so long for a beer they couldn't even drink it. It isn't your fault they're costing the bar's reputation because of some high school drama shit. You need to speak up if these people's behavior is effecting the business and customer service,  and your tips."
b'Reading this pisses me off. I hope stuff works out in your favor. I would report everything that happens to you to a manager that isn\xe2\x80\x99t the one that was slacking. If you dont have another manager, I would write down what happens and report it to the owner. If you want to quit, I would get another job lined up before you did so. '
b"The problem with bullying is that the bullies are going to mess with you until you tell them to piss up a rope.  If I had to guess, I'd say you have probably been bullied quite a bit and are rather shy, therfore standing up for yourself is the last thing you feel like doing and the thought fills you with horror. Your bullies at work smell that fear.  We all have to set boundaries in life and we all have to learn how to say no.  Read up on it for now, watch from Youtube videos, breathe,  and seriously thank the universe for a customer who recognized that crap and is willing to help you. You can do this and maybe it will help you to remember that you are helping the next server who is too shy to write to reddit.  Make it about them if you must."
b'Don\xe2\x80\x99t quit. See what happens first. They may end up fired. I understand what you\xe2\x80\x99re going through, but if you stick it out it may be better for you.'
b'Why are you embarrassed? You should be furious. As one introvert to another you need to find that you have a voice and don\'t be afraid to use it, or you\'re going to spend the rest of your life apologizing for other people bumping into you! \n\nI hope your boss shames the fuck out of your coworkers and makes them feel like the children they are behaving like. So what if everyone hates you after, they apparently hated you already so fuck them. Do your job and be the only actual adult there. And tell them like it is like "maybe if you were all better at your job you wouldn\'t feel the need to sabotage someone who is."'
b'I completely understand what its like for coworkers to be completely unhelpful for no reason. How they treated you is childish and unreasonable, there is no excuse for that kind of behaviour from an adult. \n\nI find it hard to assert myself when people are messing with my job also, but next time someone puts a job on you that isn\'t yours, try saying "I cant right now" or "I have too much backed up myself to be able to do yours". \n\n'
b'Don\'t quit! You\'re working circles around them. You do you. Keep up the good work. You\'ve got the attention of the owner now. If your coworkers and "manager"keep being shitty to you then take it up with the owner. They\'ll be out of jobs soon enough. \n\nYou are always going to have to deal with shitty people. They\'re everywhere, every job. You be better than them. You\'ll thrive and they\'ll hop from job to job while blaming everyone else for they\'re problems.\nHold your head high, sweetheart.'
b'I\xe2\x80\x99d be damned if I\xe2\x80\x99d feel humiliated. I hear you and understand where you\xe2\x80\x99re coming from, but I encourage you to step back and look at it impartially, if you can. \n\nThe coworkers are acting like immature and petty bullies, manager included, and they all deserve consequences for their unprofessional behavior. You can be sure their attitudes are costing the owner money and causing ill will in the community.\n\nIf things don\xe2\x80\x99t change quickly, I would be putting feelers out for a different job. Screw them.'
b"As a business owner, I'd rather have someone complain to me so that I could get the bad apples out of the staff, and replace them with better people.  Neither the bartender nor the manager behaved appropriately, and I think your table was right to complain.\n\nI think it says a lot of good things about you that you don't want to stir up drama, but if you were my employee, I'd be coaching you on not letting people treat you like a doormat, either."
b'Stay strong, don\xe2\x80\x99t let people bully you! Don\xe2\x80\x99t just quit, it will only give them assurance they can do that shit to anyone! Please update us after your meeting!!'
b'If people arent doing their job, let things go to shit. People take advantage of those who step outside of their obligations. Been there done thay. And if you get blamed, say its not your job to do everyone elses and if you still get blamed, quit'
b'Im like you in a lot of ways from what I can tell. I have had coworkers like yours as well. I hope they don\xe2\x80\x99t end up being the reason you lose a job you like. I always put up with bullshit like that because I was always afraid of losing a job. Idk what advice to even give you except that in my experiences the assholes usually ended up quitting at some point. Hope things get better! Glad your customers stood up for you!'
b"Man I don't know what it is about the restaurant industry that brings out the bitchy teenage girl in people. I've had a lot of different types of jobs but this kind of thing seems to only happen in restaurants. Why can't people just do their jobs, make their money, and go home instead of antagonizing others?"
b"I say this as a former manager myself. When you go to that meeting, if you haven't already, be polite, be factual, whatever you do DO NOT APOLOGIZE. This implies fault on your part of which there is none. Be scrupulously factual. And do not hesitate to throw the manager especially under the bus.\n\nIt would probably be helpful if you write down what happened, review it carefully, then practice telling your story in front of a mirror. Don't beat yourself, or anyone else. Just tell what happened. Don't think of it as confrontation. Think of it as helping all of your coworkers and your owner. You are doing them a favor by helping get a problem fixed.\n\nIf there is a restaurant with about the same drive where you can make the same money you should absolutely quit and go there. Not because these girls were so obviously bitches to you which is just what bitches do, but because your manager who's job it is to prevent exactly this kind of shit did not. Obviously for whatever reason she is in their court not in her proper place which is to be above all of that and pull out the carrot and the stick on behalf of the company where necessary. Poor management in one area will absolutely lead to poor management in others which leads to lesser sales which affects you as less tips."
b'I\xe2\x80\x99m really keen to hear the follow up to this. I fucking hate bitchy girls especially when there is no good reason to be that way. There is always a time when you need to stand up and confront people or situations. I guess you are very young though but do yourself a big favour and challenge yourself to stand up and speak out otherwise people will walk all over you and take advantage of you every chance they get. You\xe2\x80\x99ll be glad later in life that you did. '
b"u/privatepirate66, I know how you are feeling.  I'm 52 and people are still doing this to me.  I get humiliated really easy.  I also was verbally abused by my Mom, and my brother was allowed to bully me until I finally stopped it about 30 years after it started. \n\nWhen I stand up for myself, everyone says how crazy I am, and it is because I never stand up for myself and it surprises them.  I hate that mean cliquey people have done this, but I am no longer taking it from them and not saying anything because i am worrying about their feelings, rather than mine. \n\nOver the last 6 months something has happened to me and I don't really understand what it is, but the result is that I am finally standing up for myself.  My stomach hurts every time.  My chest flutters.  But I am not going to spend days in my mind hell wondering why people can't be decent to one another, and what I did to make people be jerks to me.  \n\nI did nothing to deserve it.  I am a good person. I am a valuable person. I am a loyal friend. A good listener. I care. \n\nBut I am giving up my doormat status one step at a time and I am so scared, each time I confront, but there is something inside of me that is staring out at these assholes that won't let me be taken again. \n\nI've been you, a hundred times, days, ways. You have your time and your schedule, but gently yet firmly, hug yourself inside and don't ever let anyone treat you like this again. If you can only walk away this time, and the next, and on, that is just fine.  You do you.  But don't let anyone treat you like this again.  You'll end up staying in this familiar hole like I did, for decades.  Keep moving away from it until it is no longer the familiar normal. \n"
b' To all of you who are being supportive thank you from the bottom of my heart, as I also am a shy introvert having to work and live with the public. Just knowing that there are people out there who understand and are helpful gives me so much encouragement to keep going and keep trying.\n\nAlso, good for you, OP, to keep your head up and I remain composed in the midst of all that bullying!'
b"Here's a harsh idea: just do you're supposed to do on the job and stop letting people walk all over you.\n\n\nAnd for good sake, stop trying to get shitty people to like you.\n\n\nTL;DR: get a spine"
b'Oh, god...I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen this a thousand times. \n\nYoung, attractive girl works with women in their 30s and 40s who are jealous that you\xe2\x80\x99re much younger and are more attractive to men than they are, so they go out of their way to make your life hell.\n\nThis used to happen to an ex of mine at every new job she started.  Poor thing would come home crying. '
b'Try to think of it this way, YOU have NOTHING  to be embarrassed about, you did an amazing job. Your coworkers and managers should be embarrassed and are about to have their asses handed to them by the owner. If you like this job go back with your head held high that the customers and now owner see what a hard worker you are and they all suck.'
b"Ugh. People make me.so angry. No one deserves to be treated in such a way. I too am and introvert. I however can become very confrontational if need be. But I had to work on that because it wasn't always the case. Don't be afraid to stand up for yourself. Once people realize they can walk all over you, it's game over and they're not going to stop. "
b'Don\xe2\x80\x99t be humiliated sweetheart. You didn\xe2\x80\x99t do anything wrong. Don\xe2\x80\x99t let their bad actions change your self view. You\xe2\x80\x99re not the problem. Hold your head up high. The other girls are losers. '
b'I\xe2\x80\x99m the same type of server and have always been treated like this almost everywhere I\xe2\x80\x99ve worked. I usually can suck it up or find a way to sort it but I was forced to quit my last job. I love the money from serving and most parts of the job, but I won\xe2\x80\x99t be going back if I can find something else. '
b'Your coworkers ruined those gentlemen\'s evening by treating you like shit then making them wait for drinks "to teach you a lesson". \n\nYou may be embarrassed by that shit is unprofessional and as much as I hate confrontation I\'d do the same as those men.'
b"Jesus Christ op you need to stand up for yourself. It sounds like you felt humiliated solely because people stepped in to stand up for you. If you don't take the initiative to change things, they won't change. When people take advantage of you, letting them do it will never stop it."
b"I think you're overreacting slightly. Just call them on their shit and tell them to stop fucking around and to do their goddamn job. If you say exactly that I guarantee they'll stop acting like children. They're taking advantage of your unconfrontational nature. It's sad, but some people are just like that. You gotta put them in their place otherwise they'll walk all over you. "
b'I would love that right now. Next week my schedule is down to only 3 5hr shifts instead of 5 6hr shifts because we are so slow.'
b'I think the first part is fine, you can make it less awkward by saying "I have this Groupon.  When I get the check can I just make sure I also get a copy of what it would be without the Groupon ?  I want to make sure I tip the right amount". \n\nLeave off the "I hope you treat me the same". It can come off as insulting. '
b"Don't over think it, you don't have to panic when you're first approached and try to explain your going to tip like that.  Simply be friendly to your server, order normally, and then tip well at the end.  You said it's a higher end restaurant, they're not going to treat you differently for using a groupon. "
b"Sounds like a toxic boss fostering a toxic environment. They aren't going to change, so find a new job.\n\nThat said, everyone here is unprofessional. You did literally everything wrong and deserve to be fired. You are a complete liability for the company if thats how you reacted to a shitty customer. The scene involved was not worth your pride, and frankly not a completely fungible retail employee, from the company's perspective.\n\nYour mother should not get emotional and should instead remain professional until she has another offer."
b'1. Your behavior was unacceptable. You lost total control and went off on this person. What does this say about your coping abilities and professionalism in a future situation that actually matters? By your own admission, your are the older, more responsible employee to most of your teen co-workers. Your post reflects a lack of genuine remorse or understanding- you are defensive, blaming others, taking delight in possibly hamstringing your manager and co-workers, pulling out the \xe2\x80\x9cmom card\xe2\x80\x9d, etc. Even if you are great at your job, I would hesitate to hire you because you behave like a liability.\n\n2. You are not the manager or owner, you have no skin in this game. Your manager and owner have everything to lose. The customer is always right in the sense that one social-media obsessed  or litigious-happy customer can ruin a business in an instant. How many people should lose their jobs, incomes, homes, and more all because you think giving an obnoxious customer a free pizza or whatever is dumb? Management or ownership incurs a million things you never consider as an employee.\n\n3. There is nothing wrong with working with your mom, but it is odd you claim the job market is flush yet you choose to have your mom get you a job at a cafeteria. For 3 years. I will reiterate your mom got you this job. Your behavior reflects poorly on her- did you consider that at all?\n\n4. Interactions with customers exist in a vacuum. Both people have no idea what brought each of them to this point: meaning, you have no idea why she lashed out. Maybe her mom died recently and her dad\xe2\x80\x99s caregiving is her responsibility while she is juggling a full-time job and raising kids? Or maybe she is a bitch. Who cares. The point is, step outside of your myopic view. Instead of focusing on the anger you feel at being talked-down-to, redirect it. Disarm her. It is one of the most effective strategies in business. It works surprisingly well. \n\n5. No job is perfect. Every job has people you are meh about and things you wish you did not have to do. Customer-oriented jobs (service, industry, etc.) can be brutal. I have my fair share of terrible customer stories too. It sucks and I empathize with anyone who has done it. \n\n6. Good luck to you and your mom. Sometimes things have to get worse before they get better. Learn to be less of an entitled asshole. One day you will look back and this will be a blip. \xf0\x9f\x91\x8d\xf0\x9f\x8f\xbc\n\nEdit: go back and re-read everything you wrote. Especially in how you describe your co-workers, boss, customers, and that particular customer. Now focus on how you describe yourself and how you naturally process/respond to being asked to do your job duties. You use so many unkind words. Please reflect seriously on these things. '
b'OP, it\xe2\x80\x99s okay that you lost your temper. No one is perfect. You\xe2\x80\x99re allowed an off day, especially after doing all that you\xe2\x80\x99ve done for that place, and if the boss is going to act like a fifteen year old boy, you deserve to go somewhere where your hard work is appreciated. And I wish your mom the best of luck in finding a new job! She sounds awesome!'
b'You\'ve been at the job 3 years and your mom 10(?) years, and you\'re going to end it like this?\n\nBecause you were wrong.  You can maintain your dignity and refuse to take shit from people without hopping down into the gutter with them.  I don\'t know why your "boss" didn\'t fire you on the spot.\n\nBut here\'s my thought, since he didn\'t.  Does he usually have your back?  Does he expect you to accept being verbally assaulted as part of the job?  What\'s his history here, and I\'m not talking about hiring teenaged eye candy.  \n\n**Does he take care of you and your mom?**\n\nIf he\'s been good to you guys, and you like your jobs, you need to find a way to discuss what happened with him.  Why would you drag your mom off from a job she likes?\n\nHonestly, you need to grow up.  '
b"No offense man but literally 60% of this story is information the reader absolutely does not need. The entire first few paragraphs are totally irrelevant. The character count can literally be cut in half.\n\n---------------\n\n> 3 years ago, I started working at my mother's workplace. I have a bit of a temper, and a strong personallity to boot.\n> \n> This week, I had the good fortune (/s) of meeting the most entitled, condescending customer in the entire world. She berated us because her 2mm thick, brown at the bottom pizza crust was RAW, how it was disgusting, and went on a tirade about our improper cooking method. It was BAD. And I lost my temper, just as bad. I swore at her and just about literally asked her to fuck off. Considering the kind of moron she was, she off course asked to speak to the boss. Not manager, BOSS. And the cashier, not knowing what to do, gave her the boss' personnal phone number.\n> \n> I thought that 3 years of good work and being loved by the regular would make him question what was going on. Instead, what I got was a phone call of the boss refusing to hear my side, throwing ten time more obscenities my way than I had at the moronic customers, and him proclaiming 'You really don't know me! Just wait in two weeks and you'll see how I'm going to deal with you!!!'\n> \n> I'll be honest. I was devastated. 3 years of good service, only for him to immediately take the word of a shit stain? \n> \n> Yesterday was my day off. I spent it giving my resume around. And the job market around here is VERY good for the employees right now. I got a trial day lined up friday next week, at a place where I really hit it off with the owner. Chances are, by the time the boss does come back from his vacation? I'll have a brand new job.\n> \n> Oh, and the cherry on top of all this? Remember how I said my mom worked at the same place? She's been there for over 10 years, and is his lead cook. Well, she was just as pissed at me being treated that way, and she's coming over tommorow for us to update her resume and send it over to a few prospective employers. I have no doubt that she'll find something VERY quickly. Hope you have fun replacing two of your best employees, asshole.\n> \n"
b'When I have a party of 6 or more I always ask before walking away from the table how the checks will be split "for their convenience." That way I can ring it in appropriately and by check time I just hit split check and bam we\'re done. Took me too long to realize I should be doing it this way, but it saves me time now so I\'m happy.'
b'I don\xe2\x80\x99t see how you\xe2\x80\x99re at fault here. If you have a dirty utensil it\xe2\x80\x99s not a big deal to get a replacement. \n\nIf you aren\xe2\x80\x99t going to use it then you might as well just leave it alone and give it to the server with one of your plates. '
b"I mean yeah some customers are fucking annoying and rude but I don't think it's a good look for your restaurant if your servers tell people to fuck off all the time. Yeah, maybe it would be less than 5 times a year with your rule, but if you have 10 servers, and they used it 4 times a year, that's 40 times they pop off on a customer. Which is almost once a week. What if you earn a bad reputation?"
b'Just do what that one episode of "Sonic Says" says to do. First you tell them "No", then you get outta there. But seriously, if someone grabs you like that, CAUSE A SCENE. Tell them to let go assertively and ask anyone nearby for help if that doesn\'t work. '
b'You got a smile. I wish i gould give you something more.'
b"I am so mad at this post. I hope your issue gets better because you don't deserve any of that\n"
b"We arrived a few minutes late to a dinner once and I leaned down to kiss my daughter-in-law on the cheek. She turned toward me just as my lips made contact and *my mouth was against a complete stranger's*. Our server sat down in her seat to take the table's drink orders and go over the specials while my DIL was washing her hands. \n\nMy son started laughing so hard it drew attention from all over. Our server was a good sport, fortunately - I think it was obvious that I didn't make out with her deliberately. \xf0\x9f\x92\x8b"
b'I used to work at a quick lube and I had a guy "accidently" bump into me, rub his hands straight across my boobs, and say "oops." I was told he\'s old and to get over it. We had another customer nobody could stand and the saying at work was basically, "Creepy customer is going to rape my name." My boss came up with that saying, didn\'t do a damn thing, same guy who told me to get over it. Until I was left alone with this dude, creepy customer, not creepy old dude, and he kissed me on the neck. I just walked on to the floor and nobody wants there. I walked into the office after he left and they were holding back my assistant manager, but I shouldn\'t have been left alone in the first place. It took sexual assault before they would ban the mofo. This was only two or three years ago. Men still don\'t really care about women\'s safety. Notice it was OP\'s female manager who did something and my AM who was being held back was female.'
b'Yikes. That is the absolute worst I\xe2\x80\x99m so sorry. I absolutely hate customers who do this to servers because we\xe2\x80\x99re basically trapped into being nice to you in order to do our job.\n\nI had a regular who would rub my shoulders almost down to my boob while I was taking his order. My male coworkers thought it was hilarious for some reason. To this day I refuse to take him if he comes in. '
b'You said this guy doesn\'t know he\'s being inappropriate.  Trust me, he knows exactly what he\'s doing.\n\nHe\'s counting on your politeness to allow him to be a douche and get away with it.\n\nThere\'s nothing wrong with being blunt with people like this.  The first time, I would have politely told him "Please do not touch me".\n\nThe second time I would have been less polite and less politely, "I told you DO NOT TOUCH ME".\n\nIf it happened again, I would have said "GET YOUR HANDS OFF ME!".\n\nIf your manager does not stand up for you in situations like this, you need to go over their head.  If their manager allows it to continue, you need to find a new job.'
b"One time on of my staff made a comment that a customer was cute, and left it at that. Apparently another staff member who was friends with the customer told her that the stuff member thought she was cute.\n\n20 minutes later, some high school senior full contact running start tackles my 22 year old staff member into the pool (lifeguards watching a public pool) and yells something about staying away from some girl.\n\nI file a trespass warning and kick the whole group out.\n\nMy manager takes the customer's side and said our staff shouldnt have commented on the looks of a patron and that the assault was justified.\n\nI asked her to clarify that she was ok with a customer physically assaulting an employee and she said yes.\n\nEven if it was inappropriate (employee said nothing more than 'she is cute'), it doesnt deserve a physical altercation.\n\nManagers can be fucking disgusting people. Glad yours had your back."
b'What was the situation last time? I work with mostly girls and managers that aren\xe2\x80\x99t so upfront so I feel kind of protective when guests start to act inappropriately.'
b'So happy that your manager responded the way that she did!  At a restaurant I previously worked at I once had a customer corner me in a hallway, grab my face, and kiss me.  I had given this man so signals that it was okay to touch me and our interaction had consisted entirely of friendly conversation as I was serving his table.  I was in shock and very upset, a reaction to which my co-workers wanted to punch the guy in the face but the owner told me "thats how this industry can be, you need to get thicker skin."  Happy to say that I no longer work there and my current managers would never allow that situation to happen.'
b'I hate this. \n\nBut at the same time, we had a local high school dance in our area last night. I stayed late to help with the crowds. Everyone else was bitching that kids don\xe2\x80\x99t tip/it\xe2\x80\x99s not worth their money. I just treated the kids like real humans and tried to be polite. I made about $70 total off of five tables of high schoolers. \n\nI feel like situations where people have premeditated expectations about a big or small tip are hit or miss, and I just try to give service that I\xe2\x80\x99m proud of. Last night it paid off. \n\n&Today I worked for five hours and left with $6. \n\nSo don\xe2\x80\x99t feel too discouraged. You\xe2\x80\x99ll have better people than this come around. He already had his mind made up when he sat down though, I think. Because you weren\xe2\x80\x99t his *regular* server/bartender. '
b'I\xe2\x80\x99ve had a customer ask if I can debone the wings for them and I had to take a pause to process what they were asking of me'
b"Yeah she was trying to play you. Although her tactics obviously didn't develop any further from those of a 12 year old's."
b'I\'ve had a similar situation. Dude called to make a pick-up order like that and wanted soup, which we don\'t have before about 10:30am. It definitely was before 10:30am. He asked if he could get soup, I said no. He started asking about each individual soup we offer. I keep repeating that we don\'t have soups ready till about 10:30. Each time he\'d pick another soup to ask about, sometimes doubling up and asking about a soup he\'d already asked about. This went on four like 10 minutes before he picked something else to order.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen he came in to pick up his order, my GM took him and what does dude ask?\n\n"Do you guys have any soups ready?" (no) "Do you have (soup name) ready?" (no) \\*lather, rinse, repeat for another couple minutes\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI went in the back after witnessing that and stress laughed till I could handle people again.'
b'If only you could just [write it down for her](https://i.makeagif.com/media/3-22-2016/rBIP6r.gif).'
b'do you work at BDubs? i work there and people are so annoying about boneless vs traditional, they hem and haw over which one they want like it\xe2\x80\x99s the end of the world'
b"My boss gave me one last night, I've been working at this pizza shop for 4 years now and he's only a new owner of 6 months but we get along well (hopefully becoming a manager soon yay) and it's the first time an owner made me feel appreciated. "
b'sometimes its the same if you drop the bill xD'
b'Nope the only time I ever split tips evenly when training was when I worked with a girl in her 3 rd night training that was phenomenal! She had everything down and we moved like we had worked together for years.  \n \nOther than that I would give trainees 20-40 to add to their training wages.  If he is complaining now about not getting an even split on his first day, he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be brought back for a second shift in the bar.  If he acts like that his first night imagine how he will be later on.  That\xe2\x80\x99s not a good vibe behind the bar. \n'
b'That\xe2\x80\x99s wild. What an entitled jerk. Typically during training shifts you get zilch. I was always super appreciative if the person training me tossed me a $20 or something. I cannot imagine having the chutzpah to demand any money, let alone an even split. Yikes. I would mention it to your manager. '
b"Not only is he wrong, but his attitude is something that should be brought up to the managers.  This guy is going to really suck to work with in the future if he's throwing a hissy fit like this when the rule pretty much everywhere is you don't get tips (maybe unless they're direct) during a training shift."
b'I\xe2\x80\x99d watch out for him in the future. If he\xe2\x80\x99s this entitled, he is going to be one of THOSE co workers who will screw anyone over for money. He shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have even been tipped at all. '
b"He's training. You don't get tips while you're training. The fact that you gave him anyways extremely generous. Nobody gets tipped during training and everybody in the industry is aware of this. You might want to give the manager a heads up about this, because this guy isn't going to be much of a team player."
b"Treinee should be making higher hourly. No tips in training. If you give tips to him then it is you being nice. Further, if he is being an ass about this then I'd be sure to inform management that I'd he doesn't get over that BS then you don't think he should be behind the bar.\n\nEdit to add, the only times I ever got tips as a trainee was when I asked to split whatever was over $100, and I proceeded to work my ass off so that we got there. The trainer shouldn't be forced to make less tips while doing MORE work than usual. "
b"The entitlement is strong. I wouldn't hire this dude, imagine what he'll say when a customer doesn't give him what he thinks he deserves. Also, you didn't get paid extra to train him, you shouldn't have to pay for his training. That being said, I'd throw him a tip if he was actually helpful. "
b'I have literally never tipped out a trainee once, not a dollar. Not even on a \xe2\x80\x9cFollow 5\xe2\x80\x9d which is when they are running the show and I\xe2\x80\x99m just there for support and oversight. My tables, my tips. They get paid an hourly wage that is not $2 an hour and they get trained. I get my tips and a free meal. \n\nPlus, the amount of turnover in restaurants pretty much guarantees that about 10-20% TOPS of all the people I have trained will end up staying there. So tell me again why I need to tip them out? '
b'There will always be those people. As a server, I will give you the tip IF YOU DO THE WORK. If you don\xe2\x80\x99t, I am less inclined to tip you out #sorrynotsorry. I had a situation like this, it was a holiday and a busy party, we recruited another person (who was also not trained, in my department, supervisor of another though) and SHE WALKED AWAY AND GAVE SOME ENTITLED LITTLE BRAT FREE DRINKS TO SHUT HER UP. Needless to say I didn\xe2\x80\x99t appreciate it. But when it came time to tip her out I said \xe2\x80\x9chow much of this do you think you deserve?\xe2\x80\x9d. Maybe bitchy. But I was over there doing all the work, and she gets to take half of my tips?! Naturally she told a bs story and fucked me another time when I actually NEEDED help. Also she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t take the tips after that because I offended her. Having her there was useless anyway as she didn\xe2\x80\x99t know how to serve beer or wine or even a jack and coke. Like dude I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to show you these things because I actually WANT help, but don\xe2\x80\x99t tell me in the middle of being busy that you don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you\xe2\x80\x99re doing and expect me to give you half!! I\xe2\x80\x99ve made it a point now if I\xe2\x80\x99m training you, you learn my way. I\xe2\x80\x99m good at what I do, now get out of my way. And if you can\xe2\x80\x99t help me? I don\xe2\x80\x99t want you clouding up my tips '
b"I've only tipped out my trainee once and it was because it was one of their last training shifts and they took a few tables completely on their own. I almost never tip the trainee."
b'You were very nice to give him anything. When I trained, I was told that you don\xe2\x80\x99t get tips during training. That seems pretty standard. Trainer keeps all the tips. Once my trainer gave me about $5 maybe less for doing a good job and working hard and I felt so grateful that he thought I deserved a tip when he didn\xe2\x80\x99t have to. He got $40 and definitely didn\xe2\x80\x99t deserve it. I think it is totally fine not to split your tips with him if he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t earn them especially after how he reacted. Is he going to act like that when he gets stiffed by customers too? I think he needs to learn he won\xe2\x80\x99t always be getting the tips he hopes for.'
b"No tips for the first 3 shifts weeds out the crackheads. I'll buy my trainie dinner or a flight or something. And if they covered tables by themselves And they were amazing And it's near the end of their training I'll slide em a little extra. But I do not split my tips with them."
b'I always split with my trainees. Thats why I don\xe2\x80\x99t train anymore. But im the type of server to tip out hosts and what not when they do help me turn tables and get more money in the end. Funny you mention this bc a trainee was talking to me yesterday at the end of my shift and told me he started and finished a party of 8 while the server he was training with was taking other tables. Guess they were slammed. Ended up getting a 150 tip on the table and the server who was training pocketed all of it. Shady if you ask me. '
b"Nah, it's not rude as long as it's explained to him prior to training not to expect it. Now, I've always split tips with my trainees (with one exception) in part because building that atmosphere of teamwork and cooperation is way more valuable to me long-term than whatever money I'm giving up in the short-term.\n\nThat being said, this doesn't sound like a guy you want as a co-worker. That exception I mentioned above? It wasn't somebody who should ever have been placed behind a bar and I didn't want them sticking around. They didn't pull their weight, so they didn't get an equal share. As long as someone can show me they're trying their best and are willing to learn, I don't care if they're not at my level.\n\nSo ultimately, no it's not rude. It's completely at your discretion to decide whether or not this is a person you want to split your tips with. There are good reasons to do so, but you're under no real obligation to do so."
b'You legally don\xe2\x80\x99t have to pay for people who short you, it\xe2\x80\x99s the house.\n\nAnd yet, everyone seems to do it in the industry anyway. I\xe2\x80\x99d have made a stink about it. \n\nIf you worked at a grocery store stocking shelves and someone shoplifted something off the shelves, should you pay for it? Same idea.\n\nThat all sucks op hope your next shift makes up for it. '
b'You are not responsible for their bill!  You cannot be made to cover this. This is a write off for the business.  It can be claimed as shrink (theft) on their taxes.  '
b'I\xe2\x80\x99d auto-grat her 10% next time and save yourself the trouble. Also nice little passive dig at her inability to tip. Acknowledging that you know she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t tip well. \n\nIf she wants to tip less than 10% that\xe2\x80\x99s her prerogative but at least it will be there in black and white. She\xe2\x80\x99ll be forced to acknowledge she isn\xe2\x80\x99t tipping well and the shaming might make her change her behavior. '
b"Here's to all the managers that schedule clopens! May they... I can't think of the right thing to happen to them because I need to go to bed because I'm on a clopen!"
b'Hm. So, I\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten better at table reads after years in the industry. I also consider myself a bit of a pop psychologist, I got my associates in education before bachelors because I was really interested in child psychology. So, that being said:\n\nFirst thing is, learning to read tables. You can generally figure out in your first few moments of talking/interaction a) whether they want to joke around or are stoic and serious b) whether they want to be bothered/talked to or whether they want to be left alone/minimally pestered or frequently checked in on. To me, it\xe2\x80\x99s just figuring out what degree of this interaction to proceed with that dictates my tips.\n\nNow, I\xe2\x80\x99ve worked fine dining where we do it all the same, every table, but I\xe2\x80\x99m currently working at a Tex mex bar/grill that allows me the opportunity to be myself more with tables. \n\nOP what\xe2\x80\x99s your greeting? Like \xe2\x80\x9chow we doing today, have you dined with us before?\xe2\x80\x9d Is my go-to. Using \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cour\xe2\x80\x9d instead of \xe2\x80\x9cyour\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cmy\xe2\x80\x9d when dropping bevs/food endears you more to the guest and makes it more intimate. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have the iced tea for the gentlemen\xe2\x80\x9d comes off better than \xe2\x80\x9cYour iced tea, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSo from gauging how they\xe2\x80\x99re doing and if they\xe2\x80\x99ve been there before can open up a lot. \n\nDo you give recommendations? That\xe2\x80\x99s always a good one because it opens you up to their food and bev likes/dislikes. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have the best nachos\xe2\x80\x9d blah blah. \n\nIdk generally I\xe2\x80\x99ve found doing this opens up the window for a lot of interaction. Granted I\xe2\x80\x99m and omnivert and love talking to people. \n\nEdit: other thing is just like, eavesdropping. I had a table of two vets this past week and I overheard the one talking about CBD. When I dropped off his entree I was like beg your pardon but I heard you talking about CBD. What brand do you use? Then we riffed about CBD. Dudes tipped 30% on an $80 check. '
b'It\xe2\x80\x99s always the great guests who never come back. Well, usually. I do have a few awesome regulars. \n\nI had a group of about 5 adults who witnessed a lady at another table be rude to me and they were so nice about it when I came to check up on them. They asked me how I put up with that sort of stuff and were just very easy going. Tipped well and I\xe2\x80\x99ve never seen them since. Oh well. '
b"Fried pickles. They're not on our menu and customers can't order them, but the waitresses request them from the cooks all the time. Hands down the best fried pickles I've ever had in my life. I have no idea why they don't put them on the appetizer menu, fried pickles are basically all profit."
b'We had Pollo Borracho (drunk chicken) basicly just chicken with jalapenos a crap ton of other veggies and a kick ass brandy sauce and the we also would take jalapenos stuff them with blue cheese wrap them in prosciutto and deep fry it.... best hang over breakfast ever'
b'at my last breakfast job we used to use tortilla+random ingredients to make breakfast quesadillas, or one piece of bread + cheese to make half a grilled cheese lmao. aloha allowed to us to hit like lettuce + random ingredients and make super cheap salads or bread + ingredients to make super cheap sandwiches '
b'Fresh large fry, grilled onions, bacon (crumbled), shredded cheese, into the microwave (not what its called, its basically a microwave), topped with special sauce '
b'I don\xe2\x80\x99t abuse Vicodin anymore but lord there\xe2\x80\x99s no way I could let shit roll off my back without Suboxone '
b'I\'m "that" guy who will take late tables from other servers.  I don\'t care when I came in, if I have my side work done, etc.  Money is money.  My personal policy is you get 1 hour till the check gets dropped and you better be out 15 minutes after that.  That\'s me being overly nice too, but it is a fine dining place.  So say we close at 10, and you\'re still here at 11:20...that\'s when I\'m no longer cool.  You\'ve overstayed your welcome.'
b'I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind people coming in near close because I know I\xe2\x80\x99ll still be there cleaning for about 30 minutes after we shut, only bugs me when they order tons of drinks and sit there for an hour after close, knowing we called last orders when they came in. '
b'I do have a bias against the late tables, but it\xe2\x80\x99s only because they truly are some of the worst tippers I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever had. I don\xe2\x80\x99t rush them, I am always happy to stay later and cut the other servers because hey, money, but it\xe2\x80\x99s always, always 10% or less. \nIt makes me think that the type of person who comes in late is just synonymous with bad customer. '
b'I had a late night couple come in and They were nice so I had that same \xe2\x80\x9cok whatever\xe2\x80\x9d attitude. They ended up getting into a horrible argument about who was a worse parent and who has worse daddy issues and deep dark shit. Stayed super late past close No one in the restaurant could leave until they did. They weren\xe2\x80\x99t eating or anything, just fighting intensely. I had to keep awkwardly interrupting because we needed them to go. It was so uncomfortable'
b"We had a major snowstorm a few weeks back, so bad that we reemptively closed the restaurant for the following day.  The snow started the day before around 4, getting bad around 6.  My coworker and I offered to close because we live nearby.  My manager said we would stay open as late as it was safe and there were still customers coming in.\n\nWe didn't get any new tables after 730.  We had one table camping out until 8ish, but the roads weren't that bad so it wasn't a big deal.  Just as these customers are leaving we get a phone call.  Some guy asking if we were still open.  My boss informs him that we are, but that was subject to change.  This asshole says he wants to eat there, and will be there in 20 minutes.  My boss who for some reason tells him OK, and we stay open for this dude, the entire staff stays until 930 to wait on one person.  He left 10%.\n\nIt drives me insane the lack of etiquette when it comes to this shit.  Like a Friday or Saturday night sure, do your thing, I get it.  But a fucking snowstorm?  Get McDonald's and go home you idiot.  Don't put the lives of our staff at risk because you have to have a plate of primavera.\n\nAlso my boss wtf.  I love her but sometimes it's like why??? I get you want to be accommodating but don't complain when half the staff hates you because you make decisions like this. "
b'I think it really helps that my restaurant closes in phases. At 9 pm, the kitchen is closed and that is a HARD closed, you can\xe2\x80\x99t even get extra sauces for your food you already have. At 9:30, I do last call for the bar and as soon as I\xe2\x80\x99ve already gotten everyone\xe2\x80\x99s drinks poured, I close my register and we\xe2\x80\x99re done. All checks get dropped, cashed out, and picked up so the servers can do their check outs. At 10, when you\xe2\x80\x99ve had thirty minutes to finish your drinks/food, my manager asks you to leave, as that\xe2\x80\x99s what time we\xe2\x80\x99re \xe2\x80\x9cclosed\xe2\x80\x9d and have to pay our security for the night in a timely manner. \n\nBut in that last hour that we\xe2\x80\x99re phasing out the night, I have no problem whatsoever taking more guests because I know they can\xe2\x80\x99t actually keep me that late. I\xe2\x80\x99m usually the closing bartender anyway so if the server doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want a table, I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to do both. I\xe2\x80\x99ve made an easy extra $20-50 like that several times. '
b"Nah, I fuckin hated late customers when I was still in service. Or the people who would throw a shit fit when your menu was limited for the last half hour. Also, derived some sick pleasure from telling people they couldn't order a quesadilla after 8:30 (closed at 9, Quesadilla done on flat top, flat top turned off at 8:30)."
b'If by closing you mean last orders at 11, then asking for food at 10:59 is no problem. If it\xe2\x80\x99s a close and expect to walk out the door at 11 and you still take food orders at 10:59 then you don\xe2\x80\x99t have a leg to stand on, that\xe2\x80\x99s just a crappy management decision. If a place advertises to sell food between certain times then I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to feel bad ordering food between those times. \n\nFor reference, I\xe2\x80\x99m from and have worked in pubs/restaurants in England where there will be at least a couple hours after last food call and and probably 30 mins after last drinks where we expect customers to stick around. '
b'At the last restaurant I worked, we had an \xe2\x80\x9conly drinks in hand\xe2\x80\x9d kind of policy. If we were closed, cleaned up and ready to go, we would clear every single thing off the table, unless you managed to grab your drink. We would go so far as to sweep under their feet, wipe the tables and pull the caddy. We\xe2\x80\x99d have already picked up the check and cashed out, so at that point, who cares? \n\nThe only time it was an issue was when two women came in with very young children on a slow weeknight. They took over the closed side room\nReserved for large parties, got very hammered and actually fell asleep on the booths while the toddlers ran amok. We kept waking them, as we\xe2\x80\x99d closed 30 min ago and were literally waiting on them to leave so we could lock up and go home. They got meaner and meaner about it saying they were leaving \xe2\x80\x9cin a goddamn minute\xe2\x80\x9d but they were clearly to drunk to drive. We offered many times to call them a cab but they kept refusing, so we had no choice to call the police. He gave them a choice. Go home in a taxi, or he will take them to the drunk tank and give the kids to DCFS. They took the taxi. '
b"Exactly this. It's not that I hate late tables, it's that the type of customers that show up late aren't the type you want in the first place. Worked at a steakhouse and some dope came in 5 before close, ordering a x-well done, open flame t-bone. He then sent it back and wanted another."
b"We close at 10p most nights. Way I see it you come in at 9:59 you're still entitled to the same service every other paying guest receives. If we want to close at 10 and actually get out close to 10, then we should restructure closing times, ie kitchen closes at x:xx, bar at x:xx.\n\nHowever, the type of socially unaware ignorant asshole that comes in at 9:59 is basically letting you know upfront that they are classless river trash. How they got the valet to park the pontoon boat that they clearly live on is a mystery. "
b'I had a couple come in an hour before closing, order a drink each and a California roll to split. They camped so long that we had all finished our side work and stacked the chairs on every table. All the other servers had left already. I had given them their check but they left it sitting there while I sat to the side staring at them, the rage of a person that had an hour commute and was going to have to be right back here in the morning burning in my soul. My manager eventually started turning lights off so they paid and left '
b'Ew, same thing with our metal bread baskets, those things rarely get washed and they get all kinds of nasty gunk all over them and people will unwrap their bread and put the unwrapped bread back the the dirty basket. And salt and pepper shakers, you know how many nasty dirty hands have fondled those things, ours are disposable so they never get washed they just get thrown away when they are empty and yet you are letting little 9 month old Sally Sue suck on that thing like no tomorrow. And then think about how many other kids have probably sucked on it as well. If I see it happening I\xe2\x80\x99ll throw away the shaker when that table leaves but I can\xe2\x80\x99t sit there and baby sit it. '
b'Get outta that place. There\xe2\x80\x99s so many restaurants out there that need help. \nWhen people gang up gossip on others, it usually doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get better. '
b"You got hired by the owner outside of regular channels despite not knowing how to do the job? That's why your co-workers dislike you.\n\nIt sounds like you're starting to turn things around. I hope you have better luck at a new place now you've learned a little bit. "
b"This is a mix of different things and to you they may all seem like one big cloud of drama.  \nFirst, regarding nobody talking to you at first, that's just how it is. The restaurant industry has a very quick turnover rate. Most servers have zero interest in getting to know a new person until they've been there for a few months or at least have proven that they're able to handle the job. Otherwise what's the point, they're probably gonna just quit anyway. Don't take this part personally; it's just the nature of the job.  \n\nThat manager screaming at you about making mistakes, and the other one publicly humiliating you? They suck. That's just plain bad management. Even if you *are* really that bad at your job, they still owe you more respect than this. Discipline and corrections should always be made in private.  \n\nAs for everyone thinking you were a bitch, screw 'em. They were being petty and judgemental and forgetting you have a life outside of work. People like that are everywhere, you can't really get away from it.  \n\nBad managers are everywhere too, but yours sound especially abusive. I'd think about getting another job somewhere else. Eat at other restaurants and ask the servers how they like the management and what it's like to work there."
b"It sounds to me like you have the fortitude and wits to be a good server, and you can make a ton of money doing it. You're right to leave the place you're at. You'll make a killing somewhere else where you have supportive coworkers. Keep at it! "
b'Anyone can learn, it\'s a matter of how. In my current job I started 2 years ago, I was put with someone to train me that didn\'t want to, didn\'t know how to and wan\'t able to. They gave me a lot of bad advice and instructions. Two years later I still have to deal with some of those bad instructions because they were never corrected. These mistakes cost thousands so the company is motivated to give me proper instructions now. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTry to find someone that can and will teach you. If the others are so easy to start rumors and won\'t instruct you (which is part of their job) they probably won\'t last long. Consider asking the owner to put you with someone who will. Make sure you\'re scheduled together on slow days to help with the learning process. If the owner wants you to succeed they will be accommodating to your ability to learn.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf this "well" is poisoned as it\'s been mentioned, as an owner I would want to know. That said I wouldn\'t just take someones word for it, and would investigate further. Depending on the owner it may be good to tell them, then again it may blow things up. You will have to use your personal judgement on what kind of reaction they will have.'
b"Definately just not there. Hospitality is one of the best industries I've worked in for creating co-worker bonds. You're constantly putting a smile on your face despite crappy customers and personal situations, and sharing that with your co-workers does great things for a work relationship.\n\nYou've obviously just found a place that has bred toxic attitudes, and that happens! I worked in an all female restaurant that had so much potential to be positive, but the headchef and owner, along with a select few among the staff, created such an attitude of bitchy, snarky, mean girliness, that the entire vibe was destroyed. Even when the headchef and select staff left - the attitude remained. Your managers should never treat you like that. I'm a manager myself and my highest priority is empowering my employees to do a good job independently and having a laugh along the way.\n\nFind another place and feel sorry for those that remain in such a nasty environment. "
b"Def tell the owner about this once you leave. This treatment isnt okay and needs to be addressed. Calling out last minute /once/ makes you a bitch? Uh, no. They're fucking assholes and that's not okay."
b'A lot of restaurants have a tight knit friend group and treat anyone new like shit, I have no idea why it\xe2\x80\x99s very high school and strange (and why I always make sure to introduce myself to new hires and chat with them).  Usually you just have to ride it out and they will eventually accept you.  \n\nThat being said if you work in a busy or demanding restaurant it is very frustrating to have someone inexperienced on your shift.  They get in the weeds and you have to pick up their slack, they ask you a bunch of questions, they mess up food and drink orders that have to be corrected, slowing down the bar and kitchen for everyone else, etc.  \n\nThe first serving job you have is always going to be a shock and not everyone can hack it.  If I were you I would focus on your job first, repeat your orders, double check your orders after you ring them in, and if you don\xe2\x80\x99t know ASK.  If you have extra time help run food.  If a co-worker is in the weeds, ask what you can do to help.  Help bus tables.  Learn how to change kegs or help dishwashers.  The more things you can do to help when it\xe2\x80\x99s crazy, the more valuable you\xe2\x80\x99ll be. My restaurant is crazy high volume and we have some servers who shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be there, but if they\xe2\x80\x99re nice and work hard and try to help out then most people are happy to have them there.  Eventually you\xe2\x80\x99ll get comfortable and naturally just get better and faster, you got this! '
b'I know from personal experience that sometimes I just get tired of training. My job has a high rotation of people coming and and at first I really worked my butt off to train and my results got nowhere bc they would just quit. Another reason might be that people think you are stealing their shifts so if they don\xe2\x80\x99t help you, their money is safe. Don\xe2\x80\x99t let the negativity get you down. Stick with it till you get some experience then get a new job!'
b'You sound like you have the fortitude to be a great server.\n\nAs a long time server, some places can be incredibly toxic to new staff. I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure if it\xe2\x80\x99s the \xe2\x80\x9cfamily\xe2\x80\x9d mentality or if other servers are insecure/jealous of seeing a new face. \n\nRegardless, I was the new girl once and it gets much better. BUT if it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t, take those talents elsewhere, especially if the manager is berating you. \n\nYou don\xe2\x80\x99t owe them anything, but you owe yourself a whole lot more than this BS \xe2\x9d\xa4\xef\xb8\x8f'
b"Most restaurants I've worked at have been this way. Restaurant workers can be very suspicious of new people, until the new person proves themselves to be a good worker, who will do what they are supposed to and help with sidework like they should. I've always noticed very catty and rude workers when starting at a new restaurant, but usually a month or two in and they lighten up and you're one of them. Just remember how you feel now, and at your new place of work when a new person comes in, be the one to step up, help them out and get them trained properly as quickly as possible. "
b'I think you did your best and some restaurants can have really toxic environments. I learned this the hard way because I\xe2\x80\x99m usually really quiet and keep to myself, which in my opinion is the best way to work.\n\nAsk as many questions as possible. But don\xe2\x80\x99t let people treat you poorly. People can judge you all they want, but most likely they\xe2\x80\x99re jealous and talk shit because they have nothing better to do.\n\nFind an environment that\xe2\x80\x99s more supportive. This is an important question to ask whoever is interviewing you at the next restaurant you apply to. Ask them if they have a supportive environment. Usually they\xe2\x80\x99ll say yes, but gauge the answer and even watch how the servers work with each other. \n\nGood luck OP!'
b"I just want to let you know that people will always gossip!!! My advice to you is to not get involved. You're just there to make money! Trust me, it'll save you a lot of trouble in the long run ;)"
b"People don't like you because you got an easy in while lacking any experience whatsoever, it seems.\n\nImportant to know - Did you get a server job from the get go?\n\nFollow up question - Are there any bussers there that were probably just skipped right over for a server position? Maybe people your coworkers like a lot?\n\nPeople hate any form of nepotism when it isn't benefiting them. Its just how it goes. Part of me also assumes that you exhibited some subconscious mannerisms that gave people a poor taste - not anything that you can necessarily help, but if you see from the perspective that you already have a few marks against you, this can go a long way. It doesn't take much for people to start acting like fucking animals.\n\nSo, no offense to you but this is why everyone doesn't think you're a treasure to behold. They see you as just skipping over hierarchy they all had to work through.\n\nI want to cap my comment off by saying I wish you the best of luck, that you should take any knowledge/experience you've gathered and find a new position, or tough it out because you have the owner's backing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;"
b'I was the head cook at a restaurant and the front end manager would comp her guests  food 100% for the tiniest reasons whenever she was on bar. It pissed me off so much'
b'Visit EVERY one of your tables in one trip, write down what each needs, bring it all back in one trip. Keep your eye on EVERYONE\xe2\x80\x99s face and table.  Keep a smile, never let them see you stressed. Consolidate Consolidate Consolidate!!! And do t take on more than you know you can handle. Ask other for help where needed.'
b"Everything that has been said so far is so true. One thing that has always helped me is be completely honest with your tables. If you know you cant get to them for a minute or two, just let them know as your passing them. Honestly that is literally like a server hall pass.\n\nAlso, read your guests. Youll learn to know who is going to get pissed off at you and who's not if you're a little slow with them. Has saved my ass many times.\n\nFinally, you're only human bab. We serve food not save lives, some people are going to be arseholes even if they were you're only table. Deep breath and carry on xx"
b'A lot comes with time and practice. I found that not hurrying actually helped me get things done faster: if I walked calmly from place to place, it helped keep my mind calm and I could think more clearly, forget fewer things. '
b"So first, cut yourself some slack because you just started and like you said the kitchen is a shitshow so it isn't all on you. In regards to remembering things, I would take a mental inventory of all your tables when you are taking care of something for one. For example, let's say you have tables 1-5; table 1 asked you for more water so you bring the pitcher to them, make sure you look around at all your other tables to make sure they are topped off, even if you are busy and have 13423521345 things to do it saves time overall and makes the tables feel like they are being taken care of. \n\nAnother tip is to anticipate needs and get it for them ahead of time. let's say your table orders fries and you need to deliver a ketchup bottle to them, make sure you bring the ketchup to the table right after you put the order in so you don't forget and then they are stuck waiting while you run to get it and their food gets cold. BUT you will have a hard time remembering if you are stressed/feeling weeded so make sure you are staying calm throughout.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHope this helps! Honestly tips like these would be so much easier to show in person rather than writing them down! "
b'If at all possible, I\'ll roll silverware before I get sat to kill time. Sure doing more side work isn\'t the most fun way to spend the lull before a rush but it has saved my ass more than once, so I made a habit out of it.\n\nAlso, at wal-mart there are little coupon organizers that I\'ve found fit into my apron (bistro) so I\'ll keep kid\'s menus in there, liquor lists/ bar menus, daily special menus, my credit card slips and change bank in it. This way I\'ve saved steps in that I won\'t have to run to the POS stand or host station for menus or whatnot.\n\nUse whatever spare second you have to check your tables for drink refills, and while refilling take inventory of what your tables need. Remember that efficiency is best and that if a table gets upset because you don\'t appear to be jumping out of your skin the minute they say they need something, it\'s not the end of the world. Pace yourself by setting realistic mini goals and accomplishing them in sequential order.\n\nIF you\'re working a double and can afford the time, help the kitchen staff with their prep work. I\'ve learned that it:\n\n1. gets you "in" with them and your food won\'t be as slow to come out/last minute fires you need won\'t take as long either\n2. you\'ll know what dishes they will have enough food prepped for so the 86 list will already be in the back of your mind, knowing is half the battle\n3. they may teach you a few culinary tricks worth knowing\n\nYou mentioned not remembering things for tables... try self evaluating here. How do you best remember things? Shapes? Numbers? Colors? Names?\n\nI remember numbers. Every table was their number. So 412 needs seafood sauce, 432 needs 2 sodas... etc. In my mind though: 412 1 sm SF, 432 2 lg CC. I\'ll write down notes if the list got too large, always on the same page as their order but sideways so I\'ll know what was an add on.\n\nGOOD LUCK DEAR <3 you got dis!!'
b"Also something I rlly struggle with is short hand, but I've figured the slower I speak the slower they will give me their order."
b'These types of stories are the only ones I want to read from this sub. They never fail to give me that warm, fuzzy feeling. Glad it worked out for you OP!'
b'This is a nice one to read. I used to have nights like that in my old restaurant. Things seem like they could go off the deep end, but with a bit of luck and patience it all ends up well. :) '
b"I can't always do it but I try to reward service even knowing they don't control how the kitchen works.  On the other end I had to leave a TGIpplebeeilihans the other day because no one ever came to my table.  For like 10 minutes.  That's on the hostess but JFC right? "
b"I'm so glad it turned out well. Having things come out well is always good, but having them come out well in a stressful situation is so much better.\n\nAnd you're a good writer, OP :)"
b"I am reading this on the train, on my way to work right at this moment and I've been having a not-so-good day.\nBut this just totally lightened up my mood and I'm going to work feeling much better now.\nGood on you and I wish you all the best at work!"
b'And her Yelp review will start with \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m only rating one star because Yelp won\xe2\x80\x99t let me give zero...\xe2\x80\x9d'
b"I only worked in a drive-thru for a week before I quit. I had plenty of people honking at me. Even had some people threaten to climb through the window to beat my ass. With a horrible manager by my side constantly criticizing my every move, I couldn't take it anymore.\n\nI laughed at my next job where people said customers are horrible. The worst ones were just par for the course at my last job."
b'If I have more then one table I just tell them I\'ll get it right after I check on that other table that also needs 5 things. I always ask "if there\'s anything else beside item x" if they say and change there mind now you\'re waiting.'
b"Definitely have felt this. It's a genuine let down, man haha."
b'Once served a 40th where the "birthday girl" said she should be getting something free. She was already getting her meal for free as she had signed up to our birthday club. However, it was a big party, and we weren\'t a cheap venue; the check would likely end up around $500, so I said I could do a shot of tequila. She immediately tried to push for top-shelf tequila shots for all the adults \xf0\x9f\x99\x84'
b'My favorite birthday story is actually good.   The day our son turned 21 we went to Vegas.  Got to the hotel around 10 AM,  checked in and they stored our luggage as it was too early to go to the rooms.    Headed to the casino to gamble and drink.   Cocktail server comes to get our order and cards both sons and daughter in law and sees it\'s younger son\'s birthday  "Hey happy birthday!!  Drinks are on the house!!"   (They\'re free)   Told son  "See.  Already a winner."   '
b"I've gone out to restaurants for my B-day only at other people's insistence. I hate eating out. I NEVER mention that it's my B-day and I definitely don't allow anyone in my party to say anything to the server, either. I know I'd get a free slice of cake or scoop of ice cream or w/e. IDC."
b"I hope none of them got an STI.  You'd have to shut down the whole place."
b"I am not disputing you've had bad service. I wasn't there. But because you have worked in a restaurant, doesn't mean you know how all restaurants operate.\n\nThe restaurant I work at is really high paced and orders are usually NOT put out in the order they come in. \n\nIf table 1 orders dishes A,B and C, table 2 orders D and E and table 3 orders A and B, for time efficiency, dishes A and B (for tables 1 and 3) will be prepared together and consequently, table 3 will have their food before table 2. \n\nAlso, as we prepare almost everything from scratch, an empty restaurant does not mean the kitchen is not busy.\n\nYour server told you that tables of 5 take more time than tables of 2. That is not always the case, but I disagree when you say it's complete bullshit. The bigger the party, the more likely it is that someone orders a meal that takes a little longer to prepare. Since all meals should come out together, an order for one table should be out as fast as it takes to prepare the dish with the longest cooking time.\n\nAlso, why order a four course meal when you have limited time. Seems to me you played yourselves there. I would suggest that next time you go to a restaurant and have limited time, don't just expect it to be all possible,  ask the server if it is possible."
b'Were you expecting something better from Red Lobster? I\'m sure it\'s a perfectly acceptable restaurant, staffed by fine people, but come on bro. They literally advertise on tv.\n\nDon\'t order multiple course dinners when you are on a time budget. People ask me all the time "we have to leave in about an hour, but we want the tasting menu. Can that work?" Nope. That\'s on you.\n\nTickets are absolutely not always put out in the order they were placed. In fact doing so is a sign of an inefficient/amateur kitchen. \n\nI call BS on this entire post. Hospitality industry people don\'t use terms like "head chef", "waitress ", expect good service at chains that offer endless anything, order steaks at Red Lobster or have bloody Mary\'s during dinner. \n\n\n'
b"So then you know the food taking that long wasn't his fault, it was the kitchen's. I appreciate that it was an inconvenience and it can be annoying, but surely you've not had perfect nights either. Nights where things just don't go according to plan. Not everyone will  have had  as much experience as you and your group has. Plus, Red Lobster is not exactly known for being the best at anything (except those biscuits, goddamn are they delicious). It is a pain in the ass to see poor service when you know how to provide the same service well."
b"I worked for Red Lobster back in the day, and our crew was ON POINT, and had some of the best ratings in the western US.  I'm sorry for your lack of service. Seems the server was poorly trained AND didn't give 2 fucks, much less 1 fuck. I cringe when I hear of servers of that (low) caliber messing up a night out. "
b"Your manager is terrible. He should be banned from the place, not continued to be served by young women who he will assault.\n\nMaybe everyone should refuse to serve him and only send the manager to do it? She'll suddenly want him out of there!"
b"I wish you could just break someone's finger for doing something like this. Seems like it would be a just punishment."
b'The police should have been called. As good as OP\xe2\x80\x99s response was, why were the police not called? Now he\xe2\x80\x99s free to keep doing it because there weren\xe2\x80\x99t any lasting consequences. You have to think about all the women/adolescents that are yet to be sexually assaulted. This was sexual assault and I guarantee you that he will have more victims in the future because the cops are never called. OP, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry you had to go through this and I know the mix of emotions when something like this happens can be confusing and incapacitating. Please call the police if this ever happens again.'
b"I hope that you said it loud enough for others to hear. He didn't give you any privacy when he assaulted you, he should not get any when you defend yourself. "
b'Who the hell makes a documentary about them being an asshole to restaurant employees \n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s about the human condition and how people react to being treated without any dignity or respect, real galaxy brain piece\xe2\x80\x9d '
b'To be fair, there is a difference between management and manglement. Its the second one that deserves the hate.'
b"I agree that the personalized Chef coat is the best part! I have a sneaking suspicion it may be the only good part of being restaurant management. I I'm sure you are aware that most restaurant management jobs mean a pay-cut for servers? Even though a paycheck is more stable and you can count on it, it's usually less than you made in tips. At least that's been my experience."
b"The weather isn't any better in DesMoines hope the pay is lol"
b'Sometimes customers can make your day/week/month or whatever.  I had developed a regular customer who is a cat lover like me. I\xe2\x80\x99ve met his cats, he\xe2\x80\x99s met mine. Just a nice retired fellow. Well I took in a foster that unbeknownst to me ended up having advanced kidney failure that I discovered when I took him to get a bad tooth looked at. This customer had actually babysat my foster for a few days while my apartments were doing inspections and he just fell in love with him, so when I told him the news he was super sad. He ended up paying for almost all of my foster kitties vet bills and helped me pay to let him go at home when it was time. '
b'I always get confused about people who smoke weed... in most places it\'s illegal as fuck, and yet people are quite happily walking down the road either smoking it, or having just smoked it.\n\nEverybody who walks past you knows, 100%, that you are, or at least have been, smoking the stuff. It\'s not hidden, you aren\'t somehow pretending to the rest of the world you don\'t smoke it. It\'s blatantly obvious you do.\n\nI\'m actually for legalising the stuff, but until that happens, walking through the middle of town smelling of the stuff makes it very easy for the cops to know who to "stop and search" if they\'re feeling bored.'
b'Management\xe2\x80\x99s fault. Once closing down/cleaning up is underway, manager needs to tell customers to come back another time. '
b'The manager or who ever in charge needs to step in. If the restaurant manager or owner can\'t tell the customers/guests, their kitchen is closed. \n\nAn see-you tomorrow, Then that\'s a problem. A lot of food places have rules like that even 10 min\'s cause as the chemicals HITS that grill, it\'s game over.\n\nIt\'s better to tell customers or guests that the kitchen is closed, say something that lets people know you are UNABLE to make food. Saying your cleaning the \n\nfloors doesn\'t mean anything unless the grill/kitchen is involved in your sentence at the same time the word "shutting down" is.\n\n&#x200B;'
b"Sounds like the next time he comes in he needs to be told he's no longer welcomed.  My place once had a very rude regular (local drug dealer, to boot) that no server would serve twice, so when he came in one night a manager told him he was banned from ever coming back."
b"I used to live in a rural area and was always scared shitless of Australia Day, (I'm an ethnic looking guy and one year I got chased and harrassed by some absolute fuckwits) \n\nThe next year my very Aussie looking mate told me to dress up in full body paint (green and gold) and come to the beach,\n\nI got no harrassement, I had no worries, and felt  no pride whatsover as in order to not be a target of racism I had to look like one of the racists \n\nP.s I've lived in Australia all my life and fucking love this country\n"
b'At the first restaurant I worked at we would box the guest\xe2\x80\x99s food for them at their table. One of my (bizarre) coworkers was boxing up a child\xe2\x80\x99s meal and made some sort of comment about the child not finishing their meal so they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t mind sharing with her AND SHE GRABS A HANDFUL OF FRIES AND EATS THEM RIGHT THERE IN FRONT OF HER TABLE. She was very confused why they were upset and didn\xe2\x80\x99t leave her a tip. Same server who got herself locked in the walk-in freezer for 15 minutes because she thought the emergency release was a pull lever not a push'
b"My first job was as a busboy in Red Lobster around 1983. Man, me and the other busboys ate so much shrimp off peoples plates. It was astounding how many shrimp people couldn't finish. Not only that, but there was a big seafood display in the lobby, in a glassed in cooler, we completely destroyed the seafood display at the end of the evening"
b'Isn\xe2\x80\x99t he the one who talked about eating a part of a steak that was left on the plate between the time he picked it up and got back to the kitchen?  Then the customer wanted  it for his dog so he had to get the kitchen to make a new one. '
b'My place serves huge portions and people often leave a couple of slices of bacon or half a sausage patty on their plates. I once watched a customer get up from his table and go over to the recently vacated one near him, and with his fork, stab the left-over sausage patty on one of the plates, pick it up and take it to his seat and begin eating it with gusto.  Like he was proud to have caught it in the wild or something.  '
b'We called that \xe2\x80\x9cgarbage mouthing\xe2\x80\x9d when I worked at the now defunct pasta chain Semolina. My friend Kim did it all the time. I\xe2\x80\x99m not squeamish about much but the idea of eating off a stranger\xe2\x80\x99s plate makes me want to vomit. Also, my hands are dirty way too often to ever put them near my mouth. Pre bussing silverware people touched and then grabbing a fry?! Oh fuck no. \n\nPeople are gross. '
b"OH GOD NO  \n\n..says the guy who used to stuff Boneless Shanghai Wings down his gullet right off people's plates once upon a time. And Mozzarella sticks too, especially if they were still arranged in the basket like they hadn't been touched.  \n"
b"Right? I literally had a guest yesterday not be able to eat all of his mozzarella sticks so he offered the last one to me or told me to give it to my coworker. Also, if I'm starving I tend to forget that germs exist. "
b"My first job at age 16 was a dishwasher in a truck stop you can only imagine the clientele. I'm working the dinner rush one night I've been bumped up to cook. I watch one of the dishwashers trying to gross out the waitresses by eating things out of the bus tubs off people's plates. So he's got this big plate of mashed potatoes he's challeng on the girls are all around him. He takes a big bite he's smiling carrying on and all the sudden he gets this grotesque look on his face opens up and spits out about 3 cigarette butts that have been buried under the mashed potatoes"
b'Server for several years through college. Used to eat off people plates. Untouched half sandwhich, few extra pieces of some app, things that seemed untouched only.\n\nI got E.B.V. a serious viral infection, one that causes mono. Not only did I get terrible E.B.V. (the viral count in my blood was extremely high after the infection had ravaged me for a few months) I also got a heart infection along side it (miocarditis) where your heart becomes inflamed. It caused the sac around my heart, the pericardium (many of your organs are surrounded by sacs) to become thickened and inflammed (pericarditis).\n\nIt left me with a permanent feeling of being short of breath unless I was sitting down, the best way i could describe it, but it was actually much more uncomfortable than that. Words cant describe, it sucked. Dealt with it for a year before I just had surgery (pericardectomy) to remove the sac around my heart so it can expand and contract like it needs to. I have several months of recovery, it is major open heart surgery. But am glad I did it.\n\nTLDR;\nDont eat off other peoples plates. You can get extremely sick and end up having open heart surgery with a painful several month recovery.'
b"Stories like this make me grateful that everywhere I've worked had plenty of mess-up orders that never left the kitchen or just extra stuff made for us to pick on all shift. "
b'In one of my first weeks as a waiter I had a table order a nice steak and only ate half, and didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to take it. So I went to throw it out, but cut a couple slices off the untouched end of the steak. One of the vet servers saw me and thought it was disgusting, so I never did anything like that again, but in hindsight I think it was ok.'
b'I used to wash dishes at an ice cream parlor. First, I started drinking the leftover smoothie/milkshake that never made it out of the blender. Then I ate the cherries people left in their dishes, and it evolved from there. The were a lot of times I really hoped nobody came into the dishwashing area.. '
b'This is kind of horriffic.  You never know what sort of illness people have.\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s the reason you have to get a new plateat each trip to the buffet line.  You might drop a contaminated grain of rice in there and cause a hepatitis outbreak again.\n\nSo, a server eating leftovers from a customer\xe2\x80\x99s table?  Maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s norovirus again.  Northwest US, maybe you learn your measles immunity failed.  who knows, but the immune system in not perfect.'
b"Not a restaurant server but when I was in high school I worked at the movie theater and sometimes I'd find a full bucket of caramel popcorn after a long shift and I'd dump out 3/4 of it and eat some of the middle pieces. I have no regrets. "
b'Also, if you\xe2\x80\x99re that starving. Most restaurants let their employees get a discount on food. Or even give them free meals every month. For Christmas a fast food job gave me 5 free meal vouchers.'
b'I have a girl at my bar who\xe2\x80\x99s very attractive and playful so (male) customers fall in love with her. She will share wings, queso, fries, with them during her shift. Like just snacking with them while she works \xf0\x9f\x99\x84'
b"When I worked at a Ruby Tuesday in Pennsylvania, we had a huge group from New York come in and take up a whole section. They let their kids sit on their own, and clearly they all had money. Everyone ordered ribs... When we were clearing the tables at the end, it was a massive project. But they left like 5 whole racks of ribs completely untouched... Some of the other servers split them up and ate them... I was poor too, but it wasn't worth risking it."
b"We've occasionally had people sit down at a table of dirty plates, and grab a fork and start digging in.  And no, they weren't homeless, but they were dead serious about it, and thoroughly taken aback when we ripped the plates out of their hands. "
b'Every time i see something about Pratt is dislike him more'
b'I once did this by accident.\nI was at a cafe and by 2 slices of cake using a tenner from my mam\'s wallet (she was outside on a bench) and I came up short about 50p. I saw an unmarked jar next to the till and thought it was a take a penny leave a penny thing and asked if I could take from it.\nThe lady at the till gave me a weird look and "it\'s for the girls" ( all of the wait staff and kitchen staff were girls on that day.)\nI then realised my mistake and said I\'ll be right back with more money.\nI was MORTIFIED!'
b"This is the kind of person that it should be legal to just walk up, give a swift kick in the nuts to, and just keep walking.  Oh, and if you kick him hard enough to ensure he doesn't reproduce, you should get a fee paid to you from the Government as you will have saved the taxpayers quite a bit of headache down the road."
b"What a jerk!! This is why at our coffee stand we finally got tall hourglass shaped jars. To get the money out you have to turn it upside down and shake it, and use a pencil or something to snake the bills out.\n\nA real PITA to pull out, but greedy mitts can't just dip in!"
b'What a trash bag'
b"Happened to me as well. It was 5p on a busy saturday and we were swarmed with customers so I decided to just lose a little bit of faith in humanity and let it go.\n\nThat's why in bars they fill tip jars with colored water."
b"Tip jar within customer's reach.  First and worst mistake."
b'I get it. He should have asked you first. But, at his age, I think there is a chance that, at worst, he wants to get his co-worker interested. A lot of seniors develop semi-parental relationships like that. However, if he comes in again, nicely but firmly (firmly is most important) that you are not comfortable having your picture taken. Never be afraid to set boundaries. \n\n&#x200B;'
b"I have an artist customer than come through my drive thru all the time. He sketches while he waits for his food. Last time he was through I noticed he was drawing me. It brought a smile to my face actually. But I get it, I don't like my photo being taken without permission either, but I don't mind drawings."
b'We have a customer right now who refuses to ask women questions despite us being an all woman staff   he asked our warehouse manager for product information while ignoring the sales person giving him that exact information right in front of his face. '
b'I\'ve never even heard of someone ordering "whatever". Did he expect you to read his aura, the weather, his mind, and a Ouija board to discern the optimal order for his important-ness?'
b'The false "hurry"... reminds me of this time when I worked at Pita Pit: this guy came in, held his phone \\[which wasn\'t even on\\] to his ear while staring at the menu for 10 minutes. He then asks me what\'s fastest, as he\'s in a really big hurry. I point out that everything is really fast and proceed to name the 2 easiest/fastest pitas. He scoffs at the suggestions and orders a different one. As I finish it up I say "I assume you want this to go" since he was in this mega huge hurry. He looks at me like I\'m an idiot and says "No, I am going to eat it here." He then proceeds to leisurely eat his pita while reading the newspaper over the next 40 minutes.'
b'Just had a rough shift, way overdid the cleaning early on and got behind all day. Alone on the line, I\xe2\x80\x99m doing my own dishes. It was rough.\n\nJust laugh and tell them they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t survive.\n\nPeople who do dish pit full-time are incredible.'
b'Might have better luck re-posting to imgur or youtube and re-linking.'
b'You and the server both walk up to her table:\n\nServer turns to you \xe2\x80\x9cwhat would they like to order tonight?\xe2\x80\x9d -You to them \xe2\x80\x9cwhat would you like to order tonight?\xe2\x80\x9d - They answer- you look at server \xe2\x80\x9cgot that, right?

b"I'm kinda disappointed you didn't say something because A) I'd love to know this lady's response & B) jerks should be told they're jerks.  \nThat being said, I'm also sorta impressed you were able to keep quiet.  My impulse control is almost nil after a long shift which has often resulted in me saying things I probably shouldn't have.   Usually loudly."
b"I'm not entirely sure because I don't go on it but this story could go on r/talesfromretail"
b'I get it. Honestly I\xe2\x80\x99m surprised I was able to keep quiet also. I have been in this situation a million times and when I do speak up, it just leads to worse things so I\xe2\x80\x99ve learned to bite my tongue unless it\xe2\x80\x99s a way more severe situation that warrants action. I think we can all guess what the lady\xe2\x80\x99s response would be if I did say something. At the end of the day, you can\xe2\x80\x99t argue with stupid \xf0\x9f\xa4\xb7\xe2\x80\x8d\xe2\x99\x80\xef\xb8\x8f '
b"Why didn't you just say it was upside down"
b"It amazes people how many people have no clue on what a good pizza should cost.  Can't tell you how many people have sticker shock when picking up a pizza.  \n\nStick around, for as many assholes as you get like this, you will get some really cool regulars, especially in a pizza shop."
b"I was a bit drunk Friday night while on vacation in New Orleans. My boyfriend realized that while I was being a sweet, quiet child, I was in fact, plastered. He led me into a pizza shop that had no prices posted, and when asking how much a single slice of regular pizza would be, the nice lady replied that it would be $7... Drunk me immediately shook my head, knowing I had expensive leftovers ready to eat back at our airbnb house, and peacefully left after thanking the girl. The prices are never the staff's fault, and even as a drunk child in a city I've never been to I could understand that. "
b"What makes me sick is that they were willing to get you fired - FIRED - from your job because they didn't get a $6 or $7 credit on their check."
b'What parents make their teenage child pay separately for dinner? That\xe2\x80\x99s so bizarre, honestly that\xe2\x80\x99s the part I\xe2\x80\x99m most curious about.'
b'I hate people who are  like this. '
b"Why do people go out just to fight about the price and shout at people? I'm glad you manager stood up for you. I wish everybody would. Then these people would stop acting this way. "
b"On slow days when I'm losing my mind with boredom I pray for a table like this to come in. We don't tolerate this shit where I work. Also you have a good manager."
b'I make my own pizza at home for around $5 for a "large", but at my closest GOOD pizza place, it runs around $30 for what I like. So, if they are price conscious, they should stay home. When I want to splurge, I go for the professionally-made one.'
b'Trash gonna be trash.'
b'Our pizzas at my restaurant are between $18-26 all hand tossed and about the size of a medium pizza at a normal restaurant. It amazes me amount of people that think that\xe2\x80\x99s expensive. It\xe2\x80\x99s high quality good pizza. If you want cheap pizza go to dominos or Pizza Hut. '
b'Those savages should go eat $5 "pizza-pizza" for all eternity.'
b'I mean I get maybe trying to be "independent" of whatever but the parents couldn\'t be bothered to lend their kid a couple bucks to cover the pizza?? What a weird and embarrassing situation for all of them.'
b"Oh, man, I got hit with the ugly crying just a couple of weeks ago; there's a family that comes in regularly who has an adult daughter who suffers from a disability which makes her unable to move purposefully or talk; I've never asked, but I suspect it is cerebral palsy.  She is fed with a tube, and cannot do anything for herself. Her family treats her like a princess. I do not even know what her actual mental capacity is, but I always make sure to hold her hand and look her in the eyes and say hello, which makes her very excited. \n\n\nOne time, her older parents had brought her in and got distracted when leaving after putting her in the vehicle and left her wheelchair in the parking lot. Another one of my customers found it and brought it in and I stashed it away safely, not actually knowing whose it was. A couple hours later they realized their mistake and came back in a panic looking for it in the lot. I saw them and realized what was going on and brought the wheelchair out to them, which made them practically weep with relief.\n\n\n Just after Christmas, they brought her in and when I went to the table, Michaela was very excited and all her limbs were waving at me. There was a pretty box on the table and her parents picked up her hand and put it near the box so that she could push it toward me. Inside was a very beautiful pair of earrings which they said she had picked out just for me. When I put them on she wiggled so hard she almost fell out of her chair. After she calmed down a bit, I sat down and put my forehead against hers and looked her in the eyes for a few moments, and have never felt more connected to another human. I became overcome with emotion and had to really fight to not burst into tears at the table and I ran to the bathroom and just let it go. \n\n\nI wear the earrings every shift, just in case, so Michaela can see how much I love them when she comes in. "
b'I used to have a couple regulars, 50s/60s or so, and they were the sweetest couple.  Once I was in the process of moving and the new landlord backed out with three days before my current lease was up, so I was panicking.  In all fairness, I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t *too* worried, but mostly annoyed (I had friends and storage options).  \n\nBut, anyway, they came into my bar and we were chatting like usual and I told them about the situation and I was just griping about it.  They offered to let me stay in their guest house for as long as I needed, rent-free.  I told them it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t necessary and they played it cool.  When they paid the bill they left me a note with their addy and contact info in case I changed my mind.\n\nI went back to the cooler and started crying.  I\xe2\x80\x99m a dude (if that matters) but I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t believe the level of generosity that these two people whom I served wine every two weeks would offer. '
b'I had a couple once.The man explains that his wife had dementia as well as severe food allergies. I think he expected me to ignore her and only talk with him. I made a point in my mind to interact with her as I normally would with any guest. I also made about 3 trips to kitchen to ensure her food was allergen free. When he left he told my boss I was the \xe2\x80\x9c worst\xe2\x80\x9d server ever as he gave her a $20 tip on a $30 tab for me. I wish I could have thanked him. His love for his wife was apparent.'
b'I used to work at a sandwich soup shop with a coffee station and I had my regulars. One man who came in everyday for his 1:30 coffee always wanted to talk, so eventually I would take a 5 or 10 minute break to sit and chat with him. Well the new school year came around he asked if me or my daughter needed anything, I insisted we were fine and had everything we need. But before leaving one day he called my name and I ran over to the table, he left a twenty dollar bill and said for whatever we need. I will never forget that man! I deff cried in the walk-in.'
b'I really enjoyed the story, but I did NOT fall for the misleading title. ;-)  Somebody used it a couple of weeks ago.\n\nAnyway, thanks for making a bittersweet celebration better for them.'
b'I once waited on a woman who seemed standoffish and cold, almost rude. I was taken aback when she suddenly said \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry if I\xe2\x80\x99m behaving poorly, I\xe2\x80\x99m just having a tough time. I lost both of my parents recently and just got done cleaning out their house. I thought I was hungry and should get some food but I think that was a mistake.\xe2\x80\x9d She started crying so I sat down with her, hugged her and cried a little too. She thanked me and I covered her meal. We cried a little more and she went on her way. This was easily 9/10 years ago and I\xe2\x80\x99ll never forget it. '
b'I still carry a note from a table of ladies I had been serving. It\xe2\x80\x99s been 4 years now, and I think of those women often and hope they\xe2\x80\x99re happy. '
b"> who would have been 36 today. Left me a $36 tip\n\nI'd do the same thing where I them. Feeling better about the situation goes both ways like this."
b'I once managed a corner store that sold Lebanese food. The holiday season one year was tough because of family stuff. I had a customer drop off this cute tiny sock change purse. She in the note I had been looking down recently and hoped I had some time off to have fun. I had to go have a cooler cry after I opened it. '
b'I love regulars (there\xe2\x80\x99s good and there\xe2\x80\x99s bad! ). I had one guy who I had met long before switching departments, tip me $100 every single week. I was so sad to see him go. '
b'That sounds like a great last day. '
b'Sue me for not understanding completely, and I get that large groups are a pain in the ass. However, if I go into a restaurant or something alone, order a normal meal and it gets there on time and I don\'t ask or (in my opinion) receive any thing/treatment that is special, why is it a major "problem" if I don\'t tip? I came there for food, got my food at the expected time, and at best got my water refilled once (I drink slowly). Why is it expected of me to then give them extra money, for doing their baseline job? : / I understand the people who work fast, resolve issues with food if it occurs, and gets you your food quickly and deal with problems, but I don\'t get why I would need to tip every time if nothing special happened?'
b"I didn't know there was a intolerance to nuts, that's like, not even a nut allergy. That's more like an intolerance *of* nuts. But definitely more thick-skinned, instead of an almond, she's more coconut.\n\nThe nuts, the shellfish, those are valid deadly allergies. She just didn't like nuts. She's so celiac she doesn't really like washing her bread down with beer."
b'This hurts my head, and explains why when I go to some places and I ask for a "plain cheeseburger" I get asked if I still want the cheese. I tell them "yes" all the while thinking: "I would order a hamburger if I didn\'t want cheese!" I now understand the question.'
b'This reminds me of one night at my old restaurant. This man called in wanting to place a carryout and he ordered a three cheese cheeseburger with no cheese. I tried to ask him if he just wanted a hamburger, but he was adamant about getting a three cheese cheeseburger. So I charged him for the three cheese, which was a few dollars more just so he wouldn\'t throw a fit when he came in to pick up his ordered and saw "hamburger" on the check instead.'
b"Do not try to educate these people. This is really a thing. Hamburgers are fake news, in their willfully uninformed minds, it's some weird sandwich made with ground ham. Everyone (they think) knows cheeseburgers only come from cows.\nTrying to explain a cheeseless burger to these people will only result in verbal abuse or stab wounds from a plastic spork. Flat-earth indeed."
b'Have had the exact same conversation more than once. People are weird.\n\nGood for you for keeping your head and not rolling your eyes at her'
b'I know it\xe2\x80\x99s just an upsell technique, but it still annoys me to go thru a drivethru and order a hamburger, then the worker says, \xe2\x80\x9cYou want cheese on that?\xe2\x80\x9d  I usually answer \xe2\x80\x9cNo, that would make it a cheeseburger.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b"So at my work we have a regular that always orders a combo and then one extra side, but we have that same combo that comes with an extra side, and its actually cheaper than ordering separate, plus you get a little extra of the entree. As the server, we're supposed to always offer them the cheaper deal, but literally every time we'd ask they would start raising hell about it saying they dont want the extra they want it all separate, they dont care that it costs extra, i want what i want, etc. We try to warn the new servers whenever we see them walk in now."
b'This made me go through all stages of grief'
b'If I order a plain cheeseburger (and boy do I), it darn well better have cheese on it. Lady is an idiot and probably the reason I sometimes have to confirm it being on there at fast food places. :/'
b'Should have let him come crashing down on their table. \xf0\x9f\xa4\xb7'
b'"ma\'am, I\'m a **server**, not a babysitter."\n\nI\'m a receptionist and last week an unattended child kept trying to steal cookies, spill water, and would plunge his hand into the fish tank to try to pet the fish. even worse, This child only spoke Spanish and I speak mainly English. I cannot touch your child and I refuse to yell at them for you, but messing with my fish are the last straw. Shits ridic. '
b"I hate parents like this. Not only are they using the restaurant as a babysitter, they are ruining the experience of other customers. When out as a customer I've called people out for this and told them to control their child. Usually works as people are more embarrassed about being called out and don't like confrontation. Almost got into a fight a couple times but oh well. "
b'I work at a restaurant that has one entrance and two completely different sides. Parents always let their kids run around with no supervision (there are pinball/arcade games on each side, multiple rooms, it\xe2\x80\x99s a huge place). I\xe2\x80\x99m just waiting for a kid to wander out the front door, their parent none the wiser cause they are in a totally different area, not watching their spawn whatsoever. '
b'I had a similar experience. Where I was working, you can see through the roof of the bar onto a balcony and there was a child upside down, hanging from a hand rail, right next to an adult. "Right" I think "That rail won\'t take the whole weight of a mall child and \'m not having a concussion in my hotel". When I get up there and ask them not to do it again, they give me these dirty looks as if I\'m making it all up. That said, they didn\'t do it again thankfully.'
b"A girl at my job had a table who requested a new server saying she was rude because she told them they couldn't change their babies diaper ON THE FREAKING TABLE!!!! And yes there's a changing table in the bathroom. Nevermind the table next to you holding their nose."
b'I\xe2\x80\x99m the bartender where I work so I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a tip out. The servers tip me 5% of alcohol sales. I like our system. If I have a huge Togo come through and the cooks did a lot to help I\xe2\x80\x99ll split that tip with them. Ohio. '
b'I moved to the states from Sudbury, Ontario and if I remember it was similar to you(except bar was 5%, higher end), but in the states my place doesn\xe2\x80\x99t require tip-out I just tend to do 4-5% of bar sales for mine. \nEdit: we don\xe2\x80\x99t have bussers so no food tip out. '
b'My restaurant it isn\xe2\x80\x99t enforced to tip out but we\xe2\x80\x99re supposed to do 1.5% of total sales to bussers, and 1% of total sales to food runners and bar. 1.5% to bar if you\xe2\x80\x99re a cocktail server. I always end up doing more since they all help me out so much. Bay Area, CA'
b'What a miserable son of a bitch.  Just be glad that isn\xe2\x80\x99t you and how much better your life must be than his.  Rock on with your morals!!!!'
b'You were pretty nice to call him.  He sounds like a real jerk.  I would have waited for him to call.  Let him sweat a bit as he tried to track it down.  '
b'One time spot-sweeping during closing I found an envelope under a booth with the name \xe2\x80\x9cRita\xe2\x80\x9d on it, with ~$180 inside. Rather than going to my manager at the time (who later would be fired for stealing tips) I decided to hold onto the envelope. I told the hostess about it, and we looked and didn\xe2\x80\x99t have any Rita from our guest list. We waited that day and the next day to see if anyone would call about it. They never did so we split it. \n\nFinders keepers in that case OP. So, this miserable SOB got his money back, and I probably stole some retirement money from some sweet old lady. The universe is balanced. '
b'A lesson I\xe2\x80\x99ve learned is if there is an opportunity, TAKE IT! I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you expected an apology, a tip. If you wanted to feel better about yourself ,have good morals you know, keep the money and give it to someone deserving like a friend or coworker struggling. You are responsible for keeping track of your important stuff and if u drop it thats on you. Of course if a nice old lady drops a $20 in front of me ill pick it up and hand it back. But its a diff story if a douche pushes me and drops his wallet in the process. Good sir you just bought me and my friends some pizza :D.\n                                                                                           Also not to go on a rant but i hate when people donate to big charities that are nothing but money stealing corporations that don\xe2\x80\x99t actually help people in need. If you want to feel good and make the world a better place help someone directly. Buy a homeless guy a meal. Help pay for spaying a dog or cat, that reduces strays, instead of feeding them so they create more. Take a friend out for dinner and pay their meal. Trust me that would make their day if they are struggling to make ends meet. Poverty and pain is a lot closer than you probably think unless you live in a special part of the world. I\xe2\x80\x99m not saying don\xe2\x80\x99t donate to charities just the ones that make a difference.'
b'If she returned the food, then potentially give a refund.  Otherwise nope.'
b'She is clearly one of the rarest of carnivores, the one that only consumes maggots. Thus she ate all the evidence.\n\nI\'m curious though, you said she ordered a lot of food, was it for one person? A multi-order? It\'s perfectly reasonable to ask her to show proof.\n\nIf it\'s a family business, not a chain, I\'d still stick to my guns about no refund.\n\nHow did she blackmail your business? reviews online? Can you post your side of the interaction? Customers who try to rip you off for free stuff while being asshats don\'t get a lot of friends backing them online.\n\nOne thing I\'d do if it was a family business, perma-ban. You don\'t want them back. If it was a phone-in, mark that number down as a "Hi, fuck off, click"'
b'If you\xe2\x80\x99ve never had a problem with management and made a $1 error, then it\xe2\x80\x99s likely the shift pickup was rejected for some other reason. Maybe the other server asks off too much. Managers don\xe2\x80\x99t enjoy creating schedules so servers can move it all around, right? It\xe2\x80\x99s probably not you.'
b'Uuugh. Bad mix. Customers can be idiots enough without introducing something controversial like politics. And especially Trump. People either love him or hate him. Very little in between '
b'My dad has his moments when hes just a grumpy as what in general, but for the most part ive gotten lucky. He worked at wendys as his first job and someday wants to open his own resteraunt, my mom worked at Costco so she dealt with a fair bit of asshole customers im sure. Both are usually very polite unless the server is having a bad day messing up drinks and food, but they dont ever get mad just a little grumbly.'
b"Sigh... Yes.  My mom is ok (just ok), although a picky eater, but her husband always wants to be funny and cool, but he's only half of either of those things.\n\nGosh, and my sister, come to think of it... None of them really go out to nicer restaurants, so when they came to mine they struggled with the menu.  Struggled with drinks.  As the chef I tried to deal with serving them myself so they wouldn't embarrass me in front of the servers.  Didn't like the offerings, asked for substitutions, when one modified dish came out, one of them changed their order for the same dish as I was plating their modified dish...  clueless."
b'I\xe2\x80\x99ve had very similar experiences with coworkers in various restaurants over the years! Personally, I would keep concentrating on doing the absolute best you can perfecting your drinks. If you have spec sheets at your restaurant, write them down and study them at home. Talk to the other bartender and see what improvements you can make to increase efficiency and worry less about snide comments knowing that you\xe2\x80\x99re there to learn and hopefully make money! If the problem persists, restaurants really appreciate experience and you could always look elsewhere for bar work while you get more comfortable.'
b'Start asking questions. If she says you suck, ask her "in what way and how can I improve?". If she responds with something general, ask her to be more specific. Start asking her for her opinion on random things work related. If she starts to boss you around try giving her two things that need to get done and ask her which should be done first. But most importantly do all this in front of other people. It will likely end up with her being  flustered. And might highlight her attitude more with others. \n\nOne other option which is much more difficult. Try to befriend her. You say she suffers from depression. There\'s likely also anxiety and fear there as well. There are any number of reasons why she\'s got this mean mask on. Maybe what she really needs is a friend. '
b"I know what you mean by killing with kindness. It's great for customers bc you can't really say anything mean without repercussions from the boss. \n\nThat said, dont do it. People like her tend to respond to someone standing up for them selves. You can tell her off with out cussing and you shouldn't be in trouble. You might want to talk to the boss first to try that route amd see if they will do anything. However if they do not you need to return fire with words. Don't yell don't cuss but be firm and abrasive. Ask her why she acts that way. Shell probably say bc you suck. You can return by saying if she wasn't such an awful person she probably would get the promotion she's looking for. Tell her shes not your boss and to quit acting like it. If she makes personal insults, return with personal insults. Shes a bully. And bullies only respond to someone who wont take their shit. \n\nIf You want some material to use, comment back with things she says and I'll give you my best return fire off the top of my head"
b"Don't play her game, keep smiling at her and show her you're a better coworker/person, thats how you beat this type of people."
b"My sis worked at a bar that was very close to the town's yearly fair. They literally had to hire someone to run security for that one week out of the year because the Carneys tried to pull so much shit. And not one of them ever tipped her."
b'*The next day when they call* \n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh you may have left your phone here? I mean, I\xe2\x80\x99m no genius, but that sounds pretty dumb...\xe2\x80\x9d'
b"I'm confused about this, FindMyiPhone will show that the restaurant was the last location the phone was at. The person who lost the phone will call the restaurant to try to have it searched. At a certain point, you'll be scrutinized by a manager who will ask you if you saw a phone on the table while you were cleaning up. If you tell the truth that you there the phone out, you'll possibly be fired. If you lie and say you never saw it, then the managers can potentially check the cameras and see you removing the phone from the table anyways. And then you're still fired.\n\nI'm not trying to be a party pooper; this guy seemed to deserve losing his expensive phone. But throwing it out is guaranteed to cause more harm than good in the long run."
b'The hilarious part is, these kids think that a college degree guarantees success...it does not. '
b'Seriously, I hate when people act like working in service means you must have failed life. My family has been in this business for 3 generations now, I really don\'t see anything degrading in serving food? I had this group of business guys as lunch customers for a while and oh my, they had *zero* manners, seriously they acted like pigs. So bad, not only I was put-off by their behavior, another regular once told me the next time they\'re gonna sit next to him, he\'s going to change tables, because they\'ve been snorting and barfing and stuff like that the whole time and wouldn\'t even react when he said "excuse me, that\'s kinda gross" I can\'t even imagine them handling clients. \n\nAnyways, just to get a picture of them and on top of that they\'ve been of course arrogant as shit too. We have some art prints on our walls and one day they\'ve been arguing about this one picture, trying to guess who the artist was - it was Van Gogh\'s Caf\xc3\xa9 terrace at night. So I told them that when I was at their table and they looked at me like I just punched them in the face and not even talking to me, one of them said "she only knows that because she bought it" and another one "or because she cleans it and read the name" to which I replied "No. I know this because, I did go to high school too you know and this is one of the most famous paintings in the world."  They\'ve been super offended, totally was worth the awkwardness afterwards. I thought about explaining to them the difference between a server and cleaning staff too, but then I thought that might be over their heads anyways.'
b'I am going to buck the trend here. It was wrong to toss the phone. You should really worry about being the best person you can be despite how others are behaving. \n\n\nYou can all disagree, you can down vote, but you know I am right.\n\nTwo wrongs never make a right.'
b'"All those other dumbasses will just end up working here"\n\nHA \n\nAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA\n\nHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA\n\nIf that dude really thinks he\'s gonna get a job right out of college without any work experience, he\'s got an extremely depressing year ahead of him.\n\nGraduated with a degree in Mathematical Optimization with a minor in Business, still a waiter because the job market is fucked and college was kind of a scam.'
b'I worked with a women who would throw away people\xe2\x80\x99s credit cards if they left them in the check presenter if they tipped her less than 18%'
b'Their actions dictate who they are but so do yours. The high road isn\xe2\x80\x99t always the easiest path but extending compassion for others who won\xe2\x80\x99t do the same is what makes you the better person. By throwing away the phone you sunk to their level. You are no better then them you might as well have done the same. '
b"As a someone who used to work for parking enforcement and graduated with  a degree from a prestigious univeristy you are my hero! And there is absolutely no shame in hard work. A job, is a job, is a job. The way people treat service workers appalls me. You don't have to like me, you don't have to agree with me but you need to give me the same courtesy I give you."
b'I agreed with everything but why insult his girlfriend? What did she have to do with it? (Unless she was at the table insulting you?) '
b'I mean, those people were assholes and I felt for you up until the very end.\n\nBy describing his girlfriend as a fat-ass, you became just as bad as them in my book.\n\nKarma maybe?'
b'>The phone was promptly turned off and hucked into the dumpster by yours truly. Nice going genius.\n\nAw, what a shame. lol.\n\n&#x200B;'
b"From that story I can tell that they were on first year. When I was going to college I had that sort of childish thinking that I am going to achieve something, be better than someone who didn't go to college etc. But I soon realized how stupid I was and I am no way better. I am just walking different path. Seriously I've learned so much respect to people who do physical labour or basically any person who works hard.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI dont want you to think that I was some smartass who was rude to others and treat them like shit. I was polite to other people  because it is how I was raised. I've just **wrongly** thought about others that they are not ambitious etc."
b'Guess whose not getting tips anymore. Guess you all better learn to code.'
b"I would have run it through the dishwasher. Cus oopsy, you didn't go to college and didn't realize \xf0\x9f\xa4\xb7\xf0\x9f\x8f\xbb\xe2\x80\x8d\xe2\x99\x80\xef\xb8\x8f"
b"We all have insecurities of some sort but there are those of us who will try and tackle those insecurities to fix them and there are those of us who will be too scared to do that and to make themselves feel better they will go to places likes restaurants or shops and bully the staff there...\n\nI will always say be better than that, people like that win if you worry, don't let them a job is a job, pursue what you love in life and what makes you truly happy and don't worry about people who have nothing else to do in their lives but be rude to other people.\n\nA degree doesn't make you any better or smarter than other people is a piece of paper with some letters on it and honestly if one person can have it then everybody else can too and yes they may have a degree but with that they may also have a huge debt to pay back.\n\nWhen I started to work in retail I've done things with anger, revenge, frustration but I have learned to not work like that, whether you threw the phone through anger or not it doesn't matter to them because he bought one iPhone he will afford another. The lesson to learn here is you only got a temporarily satisfaction from throwing that phone you didn't win anything or your life hasn't gotten any better so I don't mean be nice to them but rather don't be like them, yes they were rude to you and maybe your staff but to trurly be better you ignore it , let it slide and just completely go on about your own job, this is how I manage to come to work in customer service with a smile honestly they are not worth your anger frustration or effort of throwing their phone away!\n\nI work for food retail as a deputy manager, also got a bachelors in ICT."
b"When someone's words have that much influence over you that means only one thing. You. Are. Weak. Talking shit to someone is one thing destruction of property another. What you did was a crime what he did was not. \n\nYou have to ponder around the fact that someone who didn't value you at all, said bad shit to you and actually made you commit a crime. You think you came out on top? You didn't you dumbass."
b'So you committed theft and destruction of property and are bragging about it '
b'Usually I\xe2\x80\x99m not for personal property destruction but boi you deserve it if you treat someone like this'
b'I think the best part of this story is the kid probably had everything handed to him and never worked a day in his life. He probably thinks he\xe2\x80\x99s going to walk out of college with a CS degree making six figures. Give it a year or two and he might be applying at your restaurant;)'
b"I would've just stolen it and sold it on Craigslist/Kijiji, then deleted the account and burner number via a VPN...and slept like an absolute baby with my $500.\n\nIf they had been chill? I'd make every effort within my power to unite them with their phone :) Wanna be a dick? I'll cop your stuff, flip it for an under market value to make the quickest buck, and laugh about it."
b'Holy shit I did this exact thing and got fired. Kinda went into some serious depression after. Doing a little better now.'

b'So whaddid you tell the "walkouts?" I imagine telling them  \'chasing you down\' would\'ve been awkward.\n'
b'Some people look for any excuse to unload or bitch at anyone. Working in customer service puts us in the front lines against the shitty public.

At least I have another story of my time in trenches. I could go on for hours about crazy customers'
b'The best way to fight ignorance and stupidity is with ignorance and stupidity. - Gallagher\n\n"WHAT!?!? I\'M SORRY, I CAN\'T HEAR YOU OVER THE SCREAMING!

b'I feel a lot of these pretty hard ...\n\nI once had an old man and his granddaughter (like 8-9 maybe?) sitting at a table next to me while I was bussing some of my tables at the end of a busy night. Keep in mind this is not my table, and I havent even really spoken to them. I was stacking some plates up on one arm when the old man gestured to me and turns and starts talking to his granddaughter (im standing maybe 3 feet away so I can hear all of it plain as day.) "You see that girl there? (Points to me) That\'s why you need to work hard and go to college so you dont end up stuck like she is!" \n\nI literally stopped picking things up to give him a dirty look. I was 19 at the time, had graduated highschool with great grades and was working on some other parts of my life before I started college. I was so dumbfounded that he said this so loudly where I could hear, and that he was sending this kind of message to this little girl. I will admit I lied slightly with my responce, but the look on his face was worth it and I bet he\'ll think twice before opening his mouth like that infront of the waitress. \n\nI took a few steps towards the table and got his attention. "Excuse me sir, I couldnt help overhear you." I turned towards the little girl now. "I wanted to say he\'s right, it is really important to work hard and to do well in school. Im doing this job to help pay my way through medical school so I can be a doctor one day." And then I picked up the rest of the plates and walked off. The man looked so embarrassed that I heard him and actually responded. '
b'I feel sorry for you, being good looking can sometimes be painful I guess. But come on the last two are hilarious!'
b'I had a lady order unlimited shrimp off the menu. Next to it on the menu is s picture of it as well (its fried popcorn shrimp) I drop the meal off and she goes "I thought the unlimited shrimp was the shrimp on the sticks :(" \n"You mean the grilled shrimp skewers?" \n"Yes! I want unlimited of that."\n\nEven when they read the menu they cant fucking get it right. '
b'This is the worst! I hate when guests think that we can read minds somehow. The menu at my restaurant has symbols next to stuff that is gluten free or can be made gluten free upon request. Some guests don\'t read as far as "upon request" and order stuff without clarifying that they need it made gluten free. Then I deliver their salad with croutons and they are like "I can\'t eat this! I\'m celiac!" as though I am personally trying to poison them. Like seriously? YOU should have told me that! I don\'t understand people who don\'t let servers know about their allergies ahead of time. If your guest had even told you about being lactose intolerant, at least you could have prevented her from ordering the dip. '
b'"Do you have chocolate milk?"\n\nNo, kid, we are a Japanese restaurant, not an American diner, why the FUCK would we even have chocolate milk?\n\n"I\'ll have Pepsi." \n\nWe don\'t have Pepsi if you actually look at the listed drinks on our menu. \n\nCustomer: *doesn\'t read menu but pretends to by doing that little circling motion with their head for a few seconds before looking up* Do you have Coke Zero? \n\nFfs, no! \n\nCustomer: *sends back one of our flavor bombs that customers can add to their ramen* I thought this was green tea ice cream\n\nWTF it LITERALLY says the name of it under the picture of the flavor bomb in the menu, and WHY THE FUCK would green tea ice cream even be on the same page as RAMEN TOPPINGS? \n'
b'*holds up order sheet "Is this the special menu?" \n\n"No, this is the order sheet that you fill out when you\'ve decided what you want."\n\n"Do you have green/curry chicken?" (this lady had a strong European accent that made her pronunciation of green and curry sound exactly alike so I wasn\'t sure if she meant curry chicken when she asked for green chicken)\n\n"Ma\'am, if you look at the menu, you can see what we have and don\'t have."\n\n"I\'m sorry, this is my first time here."\n\nMA\'AM. If you go to ANY restaurant for the first time, the common sense thing to do is PICK UP THE MENU AND READ IT. '
b'Work at a breakfast joint. Had a customer play on her phone while her friend read the menu. As I come over to take their order, the friend orders, then she goes " I don\'t know if it\'s on the menu but I\'ll have eggs, bacon and a pancake. Could you add blueberries to it?"\nThen I told her about the blueberry combo meal and opened the menu to show her.... Dumbass. Why go to a place and not look through the menu? '
b'I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry to hear about all of this OP. I\xe2\x80\x99ve not only worked 10+ years in the service industry, but have also witnessed one similar incident. Family out to eat, dad started choking, all the other guests and most of the employees just sat/stood there and stared. I was bartending at the time, so I was halfway across the restaurant feeling useless cuz I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get to him in time to help. Finally, the MOD starts to run over, but not in time to stop the father from falling over (passed out). On the way down he smacked his head on the corner of a nearby table and blood spattered everywhere. On people\xe2\x80\x99s faces, their food, their clothes and jackets... and one guy just says \xe2\x80\x9cwell I don\xe2\x80\x99t have to pay for this meal then right?\xe2\x80\x9d It stuck with me for a long time.. but don\xe2\x80\x99t let it ruin you. Being so empathetic is an OUTSTANDING quality to have and please don\xe2\x80\x99t EVER lose it and never let anyone make you feel \xe2\x80\x9cweak\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cemotional\xe2\x80\x9d for it. Second, it might help to find their obituaries in the papers and write letters to the families. It will not only show them that strangers do genuinely care, but it could also help u find closure. Lastly, if it\xe2\x80\x99s driving you to drink excessively and not sleep, maybe look into applying at a different restaurant. Change of scenery could help as well. Good luck OP and I hope this helps you. '
b'RN here (correction: RN with serious mental health issues, likely related to experiencing traumatic things at work) - death is extremely hard, especially for people who aren\xe2\x80\x99t accustomed to it and haven\xe2\x80\x99t learned how to emotionally distance themselves. What you witnessed is horrible and traumatizing. Please promise me that you will seek out a professional to speak with, even if in the adrenaline filled moment you feel ok. The most important thing you can do is to have a professional support system in place to help you address what you observed and felt and to work through the feelings. Take time off if you can afford to do so, even if it\xe2\x80\x99s just a day. Be kind to yourself. Processing the thoughts and feelings around such a terrible event is extremely tough. It\xe2\x80\x99s ok to not be ok, just take care of you \xe2\x9d\xa4\xef\xb8\x8f'
b'I\xe2\x80\x99d suggest talking to your boss about it and find yourself a therapist. Death is always hard to be around. '
b'That\xe2\x80\x99s so horrible. I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry you had to witness something like that. Spending time alone after something like that has happened can be hard. Try to not let your thoughts cycle to keep replaying those events. Talking to a therapist or even just people on here is a good way to feel less alone and talk things out. A change of scenery might be helpful like others said, it can be a good way to get your mind to calm down since you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have to look at that spot where it happened every time you go to work. Again, sorry OP. '
b'I\'m going to bring up "what do we do if someone chokes to death/vomits blood until they die in our dining room?" in our next meeting.'
b'Horrified that with the amount of blood that your restaurant didn\xe2\x80\x99t close, but not surprised... even though your dining room was sprayed with a biohazard, let\xe2\x80\x99s not lose money! \nA restaurant I worked at literally filled up with raw sewage, five inches deep; and it took corporate over two hours to shut it down.\nAnd yes, people didn\xe2\x80\x99t leave. Just kept eating with their feet in five inches of shit water.  '
b"Hey, OP, it sounds like you're having a post-traumatic stress reaction.  That's an absolutely normal reaction to seeing horrific stuff.  As a paramedic and a veteran I've been down this road myself, and I can tell you that drinking is not the best thing to do right now.  Please try to talk to someone.  In the short-term, you can text Connect at 741741.  They're PTSD experts, and can help you find coping strategies for what you're feeling right now.  The Suicide Hotline also has counselors available who have experience with traumatic stress, even if you're not suicidal.  They may be able to refer you to some local resources as well.  Their number is 1-800-662-HELP (4357).  There's also Boystown, which is geared toward children and adolescents but which has plenty of trained help standing by.  Their number is  1-800-448-3000.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease call someone ASAP.  Untreated post-traumatic stress has a tendency to get worse, so please try to get some help."
b'If you live stateside you can call your local emergency service that made the call and ask if they have someone you can talk to. We see this everyday and to say we aren\xe2\x80\x99t affected by it, well we can be and in some instances are. The civilian that sees this it can amplified tenfold by how it affected you.  Please talk to someone. You are not dealing with it in a more healthy manner.  There are better ways.  My first traumatic experience actually led me to profession.  The goods have made the bads become very outnumbered.  Good luck!'
b'Nothing to add myself.  Just want to reinforce the previous posters who said to talk to someone.  Death is always a shock, and witnessing two really intense deaths in one day is really shocking.  You are a caring person, and this has affected you deeply.  Please take care of yourself and talk to someone about it.  Peace.\n'
b'Wow, this is horrible! I\xe2\x80\x99m so sorry you had to go through this! I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe the restaurant didn\xe2\x80\x99t close, or that the manager didn\xe2\x80\x99t try to call in replacement staff or something. That\xe2\x80\x99s just traumatic!'
b'Poor form, having 2 incidents of deaths, the managers should have called it for the day and talked to the staff about counseling, as the days events were what some may see as traumatic.  \n\n\\*choking can happen, to see the guy die .. it happens\n\nsomeone profusely vomiting blood and the chaos to go with it... not so common.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;'
b'I am so sorry you had to go through that.  I hope you soon have a brighter day. '
b"You are in shock, which is perfectly normal. Both events were very traumatizing. How horrible.\n\nIf possible, reach out for help. If you have insurance, get a therapist, if not maybe a sliding scale clinic. You can even call a suicide hotline -not that you'd be suicidal, but they are there to help.\n\nI'll be sending you good energy. "
b"Holy shit. I'm so sorry.\n\nEither one of these stories by itself would be enough to motivate this advice, but both of them in one day? Damn. Please find someone to talk to. If you can afford it or have insurance, talk to a doctor/therapist. If you're religious, talk to clergy. Or get on the phone and bend the ear of some of the family/friends you've moved away from. But get it out/find a sounding board. Don't bottle it up and let it fester. What you saw was traumatic, and it would eat at anyone who has any scrap of human feeling. People need help to process that kind of thing. Don't take it all on yourself. Find a way to air it out, for your own sanity, please.\n\nAnd once again... I'm so sorry you had to witness/process this. It sucks and there's nothing at all wrong with you if you're having a hard time dealing with it. Every decent human would find this hard to process."
b"to avoid struggling from PTSD as a result of this event, it's good to talk about it within 72 hours of the event. posting this was a good idea because it allowed you to release a bit. if you can find an objective listener i would suggest talking to them. could be a stranger, you just need someone to let you reveal all your emotions without questioning or judging you. "
b"Might I also add that if you are having a difficult time finding help, go to betterhelp.com.  It's a service that matches you with counselors and from what I have heard, they do appointments outside of regular business hours. They also do text only, phone only, or video chat consults too. It can be hard to open up to someone face to face sometimes, so being in your own space and comfortable can be helpful. \nGood luck, be sure to get some counseling because it will help. That is a horrible experience that you went through. I hope that you can find some personal healing and comfort soon."
b'But did you get a good tip from the table you sat down with? '
b"honestly I hate when people do that because whenever I try to deposit them via ATM, the ATM won't accept it and I'm afraid of depositing those written-on dollar bills via teller in fear of the teller thinking that *I'm* the one who wrote on them. "
b"The worst is when people draw dicks or lewd messages - then you can't even pass them back off to customers."
b"Those are the tables that I drop their food off, walk away, and come back 25 minutes later to make sure everything is going ok.\n\nYou're a human being first, an employee second."
b'Ha ha. Good job with your burn at the end. I hope she got it. Lol'
b'Guarantee they are waiting for her to die.\n\n&#x200B;'
b"There are countries where you can expect a card to be copied as soon as you're handing it so someone. Brazil is an example where you can more or less expect it. And it seems to be more and more common in the USA, too, and they are still not even doing much about it (remembering how many shops still didn't use the EMV functions of my card was surprising me - swiping cards is so last millennium)."
b"In our area we have a roving band of old farts who go around to businesses , restaurants/retail stores/gas stations/ etc...,  just to see what they can get away with.  I learned the hard way that ya gotta nip that in the bud.   Guy opens an Italian/pizza place.  Old farts couldn't wait to come in and pull their shit.   His solution?  He will walk up to the problem tables with a bus tub and just start emptying the table.  Doesn't matter what's on that table drinks, pizza, apps, entrees, whatever right in the tub.    Tells them that he will be taking care of their bill,  get out and don't come back.   TBH  he's a dick but his place is always packed.   "
b'And then everyone clapped, including the Benjamin.\n\nThis place must make ***huge*** profits to not only ban customers for something like simply not tipping despite actually being otherwise normal customers, and also for handing out 100$ bills that easily\n\nWhy would you ever leave such a heavenly place? He only worked there *sometimes*???'
b'Heh.  I used to make pizza. I\'d take my break around 9:30, make a small, and go eat it out on the floor, in uniform.  No trouble with that except once, when some guy who\'d just ordered a pizza came up and hovered over me: "Hey, BROTHER, how about a couple slices of that pizza?"\n\nMe, tired and hungry: "You just ordered, it\'ll be out soon.  This is my dinner."\n\nBig middle finger in the air at once and he stalked off.  Guess I wasn\'t his brother after all.  There are okay people and stinkers.  The okay people outnumber the stinkers by a fair amount, but it\'s hard to remember that. '
b"Reminds me of when one of my customers requested to sample our wagyu which is $60 a plate for 3.5oz. Expecting first of all, a yes, and second of all, it being free of charge. For people that might not know, wagyu is an A5 grade beef and real wagyu has to be imported from Japan. It's not something you're just gonbe getting a free sample of. And don't give me attitude because I can't do that for you????"
b'This.  This is the reason why I stopped selling ice cream.  Had it for about 2 years,  great locally made ice cream.   The amount of time with "can I try this one and that one and the other one"  was beyond belief.  Called the company the beginning of the month and told them to come get their freezer at the end of the month.  "Love your product but just can\'t do this anymore"   For the rest of the month myself and all of my employees had no issue just saying "Nope!"   when the song and dance would begin.   "But you\'ve done this before!!!"  Our response was always  "Yeah, that\'s why we\'re getting rid of it."   '
b'This reminds me when i was a younger kid, we went out to a local pizzeria that did specialty slices and what not. They had several pizzas made and would warm the slice up to order. I asked the waitress for two slices of a specialty pizza.....without the ranch. Everyone looked at me weird and my young mind didn\xe2\x80\x99t realize they\xe2\x80\x99d have to make a whole pizza for my two slices. Hahaha'
b"The only reason I would care about dine and dashing is if it meant I was getting stiffed on a tip, as would be the case in the US. Where I'm from, servers get minimum wage and don't lose out financially if a customer decides to commit a crime.\n\nThat said, I do feel fucked over if I've been nice to someone/made them cocktails/brought their food over and they just leg it at the end of their meal. Don't dine and dash, it makes you a loser."
b'I work at a restaurant in a small Resort Town. One road in one road out. A bunch of high school kids come in one morning get hot chocolate and a couple things for breakfast. The bill is less than $80 for all eight people. A few of them head outside to play in the snow which is normal, but I notice the rest of them disappeared. I see them pile into a car and head off down the road. I called the local police which I know by name because they come in the all the time. I have them wait for them at the bottom of the road with a question and total of the bill. They pulled them over and ask if they were at my restaurant. They say yes the officer tell them I think you forgot something which one of them responds to basically "I thought they paid for it." The officer then tells them if you do not go back up there and pay I will take you all to jail for dining and dashing, impound your vehicle, and have your parents come pick it up. Because on top of this it\'s a school day and they all should be in school. So awesome to see them come back into the restaurant head hanged in shame and pay their bill, and apologize. All while my favorite officer is behind them making sure they comply. '
b"What else would you expect from dumb teens going to a hookah place thinking they're hot shit? I been around them all my life and they're all the same and I'm astounded how dumb they can be. I'm sure you don't need me to tell you that because you probably are well informed already.\n\nSide note: what happens if you don't pay you're check? So over 50 is an automatic arrest? What if it's below 50? "
b'That sounds utterly ridiculous, but I am curious about the thai ice cream shop. '
b'TIL green tea ice cream is a thing. Is that a thing you make?\n\nAnd yeah, can I have whatever he took before he came to your place? If he was in the viet conflict, he\'d be late 60\'s minimum. Can\'t rock a mullet or a sleeveless tuxedo that easily at that age. Dunno wtf with rest of that lunacy, but I bet it had lots and lots of colors.\n\n"You can turn your back on a friend, but NEVER turn your back on a drug." - Hunter S. Thompson.'
b'To be fair it could happen with a man. \n\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s an old guy in my town who I have seen shit himself while walking on two separate occasions. The poop always falls out perfectly. \n\n\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t understand why he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have a caregiver '
b'I have a horrible poop story that happened to me. This was before I was a sever. This guy came in looking terrified and in a rush, and sprinted intro the bathroom. He\xe2\x80\x99s in there for so long, and we get busy I just forget about him. I catch him quickly leaving the store later but don\xe2\x80\x99t think about it. Some customers walk in right after that and their faces curl up and they are like man it stinks in here. I had a cold so I didn\xe2\x80\x99t notice at all. \n\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s when I discover by the door, a diarrhea trail leading to the bathroom. Then diarrhea all over the bathroom. It looked worse than I can even describe it. I cried while I cleaned it all up, the owner called me and gave me a raise that night, and we ended up throwing away our mop. '
b'I used to work at a relatively fancy hotel and ran into the same issues all the time! We don\xe2\x80\x99t not want kids here but we certainly don\xe2\x80\x99t cater to children and people are so butt hurt by it all the time! People would whine that we didn\xe2\x80\x99t have a swimming pool for their kids to swim in and that we should put one in. Like no???? We have beautiful grounds and a valley (hosted a lot of weddings) to walk through like just take them for a scenic walk! And We didn\xe2\x80\x99t have kids cups and people would be so mad if I asked if a rocks glass was okay. Sometimes we had to go coffee cups with lids but that\xe2\x80\x99s the best I could do. It brought me some joy to know I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have to deal with many kids because of its reputation lol '
b'I hate customers like that! Do they really think we would waste our time and energy on cutting them off from something??? It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t even make sense\n\nBut I also served a table once who wanted a cappuccino with soy milk and I told him that we ran out of soy milk and he was noticeably mad about it and asked why we don\xe2\x80\x99t go to the grocery store next to our restaurant on a Saturday just so he can have a cappuccino. First of all just drink a coffee you pussy and second of all if one of us ran to the grocery store real quick it would have probably taken up to 30 mins and it was busy so stop acting as if the world is ending just cause we run out of things from time to time!'
b'Not a stupid story AT ALL. I ALSO work at a small Italian restaurant just like yours. Our bar only seats 8 and our dining room seats about 30 all together. We\xe2\x80\x99re constantly running out of shit and we only have 3 employees. 2 bartenders/servers and 1 chef. Lemons and limes and mixers. Very rarely do we have everything at once. The owner is a cheap fuck and a condescending asshole. I only make tips. I don\xe2\x80\x99t get paid hourly despite that being very illegal. This week I worked 5 days and only made around $200. I hate it. \n\nBut I know how aggregating it can be when you don\xe2\x80\x99t have supplies and people want their fancy ass drinks. It\xe2\x80\x99s like fuck just have a scotch straight like a man God forbid I can\xe2\x80\x99t make your chocolate latte martini. The world isn\xe2\x80\x99t going to end.'
b"Now you know where he works. Call the cops - they usually hate repo guys anyway so they'd be more than happy to pay the company a visit."
b'Repo men? No surprise that their boss is no better than they are.'
b'BOH here. Was once asked to make nachos with tartar sauce instead of our usual chilli bean sauce.\nFOH freetexted it in, so it couldn\'t have been an error, but I had to check with them anyway before I defiled the laws of man and of God in this way.\n\nWith the docket in hand, "Seriously?"\n"Seriously."\n"Well...alright then." '
b"I hate to say it, but that sounds like something I'd do. I tried fish fingers and custard after Matt Smith ate it in Doctor Who and I loved it. "
b'Back when I was bar tending I had a service bar ticket that said \xe2\x80\x9cKahlua sombrero (coffee liquor and milk) add olives\xe2\x80\x9d.  I thought the server rang it in wrong and asked him. He said no that\xe2\x80\x99s what the lady asked for and I asked for the table number so I could check just to make sure. When I got to the table it was two elderly couples. I asked them who ordered the Kahlua sombrero with olives and one of the little old ladies raised her hand and said it was her absolute favorite. The server told me later that she drank the whole thing and said it was delicious. To each their own I guess. '
b'Our proprietor had a superbowl party and I got way too drunk and started sweeping his kitchen and his wife asked what I was doing and I said "my sidework so I can go home" '
b'Sharp. Behind. Comin\xe2\x80\x99 down. Corner. Hands? *Knocks on every door upon entering/exiting* '
b'I find I do this when I go out to eat, getting up to go to the bathroom mid meal and I\xe2\x80\x99m saying \xe2\x80\x9cbehind\xe2\x80\x9d and such to random people '
b'Man i fucking said that to a grocery store worker as i was behind them with my cart, and they still managed to turn real fast and run into me. Like, dude, i fucking just said i was behind you.'
b'I say \xe2\x80\x9cbehind\xe2\x80\x9d all the time when I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to get by random people in large crowds, I once said corner while turning in my car and one while crossing the street at superstore. There was someone right next to me for the latter incident.'
b'I say behind you all the time...it\xe2\x80\x99s my \xe2\x80\x9cexcuse me\xe2\x80\x9d now and I hate it'
b'"86 CHICKEN!!" As I used my last chicken breast at home..'
b'I still catch myself saying \xe2\x80\x9cbehind\xe2\x80\x9d almost two years after getting out of the food industry. Now I just knock on my empty apartment door before I unlock it. Or even better, knocking on my own open empty bedroom door before walking in. I also knock on the storage closet doors at work. I am a CNA so we ALWAYS knock.  I always just \xe2\x80\x9cwhat the fuck?!\xe2\x80\x9d And shake my head. I also hear call lights dinging in my sleep if I work too many hours back to back. '
b'Texted the bf last night before I came upstairs with handfuls of Chinese food \xe2\x80\x9chands please\xe2\x80\x9d and one time I shouted \xe2\x80\x9ccorner\xe2\x80\x9d coming around an isle in the grocery store. \n\nWe\xe2\x80\x99re both service industry and it\xe2\x80\x99s funny seeing the things we bring home from work. We only really have pint glasses to drink out of and they\xe2\x80\x99re store upside down, basically everything in the fridge/freezer is labeled, and if we\xe2\x80\x99re both in the kitchen \xe2\x80\x9cabove you,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9csharp behind\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9chot behind\xe2\x80\x9d (albeit that one is used ironically) are frequently tossed around. Guess you can\xe2\x80\x99t really leave the industry, even when you do lol'
b"I work in a pseudo kitchen now and I'm the only one who says these kinds of things. Im gonna accidentally run someone over one of these days. Stay loud. "
b'I\'m always saying... "hot pan" when I\'m carrying the pan from stove to sink.\n It\'s  18 inches to the right. \n\nI haven\'t been in a restaurant in 14 years. (Working). Ha ha'
b'I once opened a door and said thank you to myself, if it makes you feel better.'
b'I used to work as a temp at a Toyota Plant a few years back.  They drill into you "stop, look and point" at any intersection be it inside or outside the plant. Still find myself doing this from time to time especially if I am tired.'
b'I constantly announce "corner" and "out".  Its really annoying, and I hate myself.'
b"Dont worry i say it to my cats all the time they're usually sat in the doorways when im trying to pass"
b'I was in the car with a co-worker and I was giving him directions, instead of saying left or right he asked "for here or to go?"'
b'I once said corner while I was coming up to an intersection driving. It\xe2\x80\x99s ingrained in my brain. '
b'I asked my girlfriend if she wanted a drink when she was over last week. When she said yes I asked \xe2\x80\x9cwhat size?\xe2\x80\x9d \n\nI need a break.'
b"Two years after leaving my serving job, I still say 'coming around' when going around blind corners at my new job. My coworkers think it's bizarre. I hope I never drop the habit - it's helpful. "
b'The place I worked at first had a lot of guys that English is their 3rd language, after wolof (sp?) then French. Saying excuse moi got a faster response than anything else. I\'ve morphed that habit back to English.\n\nI work in a warehouse job now. People think I\'m calling them fat because i say excuse me when there is plenty of room. So i end up explaining to lots of people "it\'s not that i need you to move out of my way, it\'s that I don\'t want your elbow swinging at my face when you turn"'
b'i was sleeping over my bfs house at a time where i was getting off super late from work. apparently i was dreaming and tapped my boyfriend with my hand and went \xe2\x80\x9cx can you please pass me the menus\xe2\x80\x9d '
b"I'm a busser at Texas Roadhouse and we always have to say corner going around a corner. A couple months before I started working there, some other server with a bunch of plates in his hands and another girl coming around the corner with a full tray of food ran into each other and it was so loud every single person in the restaurant looked at them. They were both fine but it was just loud. Since I barely started working there around a month ago, I heard myself whisper corner when I walked out of my bedroom to go to the bathroom. I didn't even realize it until I went back to my room and proceeded to say corner one more time. Pls help "
b'People always look at me confused when I give them a solid, \xe2\x80\x9cheard\xe2\x80\x9d in reply to them telling me something.'
b'I last worked in a supermarket almost 30 years ago. I still warn "watch your back" (their version of \'behind you\') when someone isn\'t paying attention and wanders into my path.'
b"Okay, everyone is talking about rude people who want food or whatever AFTER business is closed - I'm gonna talk about my biggest pet peeve when I was a breakfast waitron and discuss the a-holes that try to get you to open up early.  I got to the restaurant at 5 and we opened at 6 - there was at least an hour and a half of work to set the place up for the day and we counted on having light business until 7 to get it done.  The place was in an old house with supplies and bakery in basement so the back doors couldn't be locked - too much running up and down stairs involved.  And of course the night crew never bothered to restock anything.\n\nI hated the mornings there was a crowd milling around the front door, trying and shaking the lock and sometimes BEATING on the door to be noticed.  We couldn't set out the outside chairs or signs, because they often would use the opportunity to sneak inside and just sit at a table glaring at the opener waiting for service.  No amount of persuasion could get them out of there, I had to threaten one table with calling the police (15 of them!  15!  They snuck into the place from the back and seated themselves in a closed, dark room, and then had the gall to send someone into the kitchen complaining about lack of service).  If it was a half-hour to opening, pre-opening stealth seaters would beg for coffee until they could put in their order.  Which wasn't made yet.  And the sight of one table sitting drinking coffee would bring in a hoard, which was confusing as the streets outside would be dark and deserted.\n\nI finally left all the lights off when I worked and got good at moving around in the semi-dark.  I could still see the shadows of the hopeful outside."
b'I work in a pawn shop. We have clearly visible hours on our door. And our hours are correctly listed on google. I work ten hour shifts at my job. When hour nine approaches (closing time) I am ready to go home. But after locking the doors the next hour is spent doing the closing procedures such as counting down the drawers, counting jewelry and firearms, restocking and cleaning etc. so nothing irks me more than when someone comes 5 mins before we close. Because we HAVE to help them. So if they decide to take their time, we have to just keep helping them. Whether it\xe2\x80\x99s a pawn or a sale. So if it takes 30 mins to complete that transaction, we STILL have an hours worth of work once we let the customers out and lock the door. It\xe2\x80\x99s the one thing i truly hate about my job. '
b"The absolute worst are those who come in and say 'I used to work at 'some other place' and I hated it when people came in after we closed.' Thanks for announcing that you hate yourself too - what can I do to get you out of here?"
b'I have a kind of similar story from back when I worked nights in a convenience store. The area where I worked is a pretty quiet upper-middle class area. Night shift there was super easy. Very rare to have problem people around so it was an easy paycheck.\n\nOne night on a weekday, at around 2 or 3 am, the area had a blackout. Everything suddenly shuts down. Just a few emergency lights on along walls. As is procedure when something like that happens, we lock the door and put up a handwritten closed sign. Pretty obvious why this 24h store is closed, and it lasted about 2 hours.\n\nLots of people still drove up, but turned around when they saw the sign or realized that the door was locked. However, there were quite a few people over the course of the blackout that started pounding on the windows to be let in, or started blasting their car horns. It was pretty amazing to me. I mean the store was nearly black inside, the emergency lights making some parts of it up to dim, door locked and a sign on it saying closed in big letters. Honestly some people.... '
b"Call the cops next time. It's a danger to yall for someone to be there after hours while management is handling a lot of money at once. "
b'That\'s reminding me of one of the things I like most about France.\n\n4:00 in the morning, I\'ve been riding my bicycle through the night (at that point I had 400 of the 600km behind me, the last of which went through rural France (== no food and few water from vending machines along the way)) and it\'s smelling of freshly baked bread in the small village. I just follow the smell and find the bakery. Knocking at the window the baker, seeing the MAMIL in front of him opens, hands me a baguette ("sorry, not much else yet") and offers me a coffee with it. I had a problem to get him to accept 5\xe2\x82\xac for that.\n\nI\'ve been doing that for a few years; it\'s the reason why Ipreferred doing my brevets in Belgium and France although their roads are worse than anything I\'ve ever seen.'
b"Guess I'm old. If they want to pay cash. I'd make the sale. Item comes to $8.75 tax in give me $10 no change and it's yours. Pull out your credit card and I'll be reaching for a heavy blunt object.\n\nIs it really a huge deal to just leave a note for the morning openers to ring the sale up first thing to make the inventory adjust?"
b'Wow you seem like a pretty miserable person?\n\nMaybe help someone out? It would have taken you 2 minutes. You will need help sometime in the future, if that help doesn\xe2\x80\x99t come, refer back to this time.'
b"I'm thinking he was trying to pass fake cash."
b'This is so interesting (not the scammers, your payment system) as its the opposite in Asia. They would rather take cash than card. It\xe2\x80\x99s only in the past 2 years that I have been able to use my card to go out shopping/eating/drinking as most places would only take cash, even if I racked up a couple hundred on my check. And even then, cash is still preferable. Do you get hit a lot with fake money?'
b"so this guys was a dick, but sometimes we customers are just idiots and forget our wallets. it happens to me about once a year and i always feel like a fucking moron. but i always offer to leave something of value (phone, tablet, that kind of thing) and run to wherever i'm staying to get it. \n\nthis just happened to me about 2 months ago. i decided to walk down the (really steep) hill for dinner because i wanted to have some wine with my meal and not have to worry about driving (especially since it's a manual transmission rental on the wrong side of the road, up a hill). of course it comes time to pay and i realize i didn't put my wallet in my purse. so my brainiac self is all 'oh, i didn't drive here, i'll leave my car keys'. i'm halfway up the steep ass hill when i realize that if I'd brought my car keys with me i could have at least driven myself back down, paid, then driven back up (i ended up not drinking with dinner). i wavered and then said screw it and finished my walk. when i got back to the restaurant my server asked me if i'd walked the whole way since she had my keys (she'd asked me earlier where I was staying in town). when i said yes she just shook her head and muttered something about the 'crazy lady'. and i could do nothing but agree... before starting out to walk up the steep ass hill again.\n\nso sometimes we're not trying to scam (but that guy was) and we're just crazy people with shitty memories. :)\n\nand regarding only taking limited payment types, last year i went for lunch at a restaurant that was not so public about only accepting cash or check - neither of which i had on me. apparently it was such a common problem for them that they actually had self addressed envelopes that you could take with on the honor system and mail back with your payment when you had the chance. crazy. i opted to run to the atm a few blocks away and pay then. i wonder how many people just never pay."
b"I think Sweden is slowly going cashless, right?\n\nCertainly I've been in places where you get dirty looks for trying to pay with high denomination notes (because they don't have/want to give you change).\n\nIn England they don't like you paying with Scottish pounds sometimes (though, they kind of have a point because they're not issued by the Bank of England; still, a pound's a pound.\n\nIn Germany some places make it difficult for you by only accepting Girocard (i.e. a German debit card). So you can have a foreign debit card in euros, even with a Visa, Mastercard, Maestro etc. attached, but still can't use it. So useful. ;)\n\nSorry for the slight tangent, just some thoughts. :)"
b'A few things come to mind. I\'m glad you called him out for his shit. But I know this isn\'t in the US, but considering our cash is "legal tender for all debts" it must be accepted. I wonder if you guys have something similar. I suppose not since a business can run as credit only.'
b"As you are using \xe2\x82\xac as currency sign... I would really have liked to see the police coming in and asking you where to send the bill for their visit if the guests were able to provide sufficeint id and you didn't check that. The EU has quite some interesting rules..."
b'No, but I did once message a restaurant on FB to make a reservation (that was their standard operating procedure), and got a gibberish message back at 2am with a very apologetic follow-up the next morning. Not related but that restaurant has since closed.'
b"Recently got a little tipsy after work one day and Yelp'd my fellow people in the biz I've known over the years and gave them 5 stars and mentioned them by name. A little help from an old coworker can go a long way sometimes!"
b'Just at the weekend, our bar had a customer lose her phone, accuse our staff of stealing it when it was found charging where she left it then physically attack our barman when he tried to ask her to calm down. Security pepper sprayed her and kicked her out, and an hour or two later we got this,\n\n"Awful, not responsibilie, lost phones, gas treatment. Dont Def advice!!!!!!! 6666666"\n\nWe\'re not in an English speaking country which explains some of that but... Not the satanic possession at the end there. '
b'I always hate when the story ends with \xe2\x80\x9cher family gave me apologetic looks and left with her.\xe2\x80\x9d If you are the husband/ wife and your SO is acting like that you need to shut that shit down! Tip extra and tell your SO they are being horrible'
b'My Spanish is almost zero. But estupido Mujer springs to mind. I despise entitled creatures like that. '
b'Puta means whore. \n\nOwner should have brought over to go boxes and kicked the scammer out just for calling you that. \n\n\xc2\xbfPor qu\xc3\xa9 no le hablaste espa\xc3\xb1ol a ella?\n'
b"I have been called racist by more of my own race than any other. Not that I get called racist a lot, but it has happened.\n\nA lot of my job is on the phone.  I have an Anglo last name and I guess I don't 'sound' Hispanic (whatever that means), so I guess that is how/why it happens..."
b'I work with black servers that have been called racist before by black customers. Kind of makes me feel better to know that sometimes people are just crazy because being called racist sucks.'
b"They came in ready to burn you from the rip. When I get one of these tables, and I know 100% exactly that table, I've waited on the same garbage many times, I tell my managers that the table is going to be shitty, want everything comped, free desserts and a free meal. After 15 years of doing this, I immediately know the vibe. You absolutely couldn't have done anything to make their night. They're all around garbage people intentionally being shitty to not have to pay for anything.  Next time give them shit service. They're not going to tip you anyway.  Fortunately,  its not common, but it will happen again. "
b'For my 16th birthday I asked all my friends to go to BWW with me. My mom gave me $100 to pay for the meal because *she already knew*. I figured at least one person would pull a \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t bring enough money\xe2\x80\x9d on me. Nope. All of them. Every single person. The bill came out to like $98 and some change. I demanded they leave the money they brought as a tip. I remember being super annoyed because one girls sister found out I paid for the meals and said I should have invited her too if I was doing that. One guy was prepared to pay for his own meal in its entirety, and that\xe2\x80\x99s the only person I\xe2\x80\x99ve shared a meal with since that night. '
b'Why are people so horrible?   This stuff hurts, and I see it way too often.   \n\nI had four stiffs last night, all of them two tops in the $50-$70 range, none of them had a single problem with their meals.   '
b"That's crazy. \n\nI once went out to dinner at a casual restaurant and the place was dead, which was great. There were four of us, we were seated near a cozy fireplace, and the waiter was quick with our drinks. \n\nWe were all enjoying relaxing and visiting when the waiter came over and apologized for our food taking so long. Apparently it had been about 30 minutes, but we didn't notice as we were just enjoying each other's company. The food arrived maybe 10 minutes later and it was delicious. \n\nThe waiter bought the check, apologized yet again for the slow service, and said our meals had been comped. That actually embarrassed me because it was seriously not a big deal. I thanked him. The check was about $120. \n\nWe put $120 in cash with the check, left the table rather quickly, and made sure he picked up the check cover.\n\nI hope he got to keep it all.\n.\n\n"
b'Argh!!  Your manager needs to stop comping obvious bullshit.'
b'Massively useless manager.  This is why restaurants go under.  Comp all their food because you refuse to stand up to customers who obviously come to eat for free?  She needs to be fired.'
b'These type of people are why I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be a server. I would end up fired for being sarcastic to downright rude. I eventually would not be able keep from telling these people \xe2\x80\x98wanna know why you always end up with \xe2\x80\x98shitty\xe2\x80\x99 service? It\xe2\x80\x99s because of your shitty attitude. We can spot people like you pretty quickly. You complain about everything and want it all comped and never tip, so why should I put out a lot of effort if I know nothing I do is going to be good enough? I\xe2\x80\x99d rather put my energy towards customers that are decent human beings and deserve my best attention.\xe2\x80\x99'
b'Tables like that are so draining, they run you around and the whole time you know it won\'t be worth it and something will still be "wrong" but if you even let it show a little bit that they are being demanding or unreasonable you\'ve given them another straw to grasp on to for a complaint. (Btw based on the menu items listed I might know the restaurant lol if the BBQ is a  "New Orleans BBQ" sauce) \n\n\nMy favorite are the "10+tops" at 9pm or later that inevitably only 3-5 arrive within the first hour and rest trickle in one at a time. Meanwhile there\'s always one more person "almost here" and then most of them order the lob Mac as an entree with fries or one stuffed chicken, then all want separate checks and suddenly no one had any fries or Mac and cheese. \xf0\x9f\x99\x84\n\nWow this comment got long, I could vent forever about crazy guests lol'
b'This sub makes me tip more and hate humans more as well.'
b'Ugh. This is why I can\xe2\x80\x99t wait to own my own restaurant. When they complained about the sides that\xe2\x80\x99s when I would have lost it. \xe2\x80\x9cLadies I watched the Chef cook this himself, you have two options you can leave now (without eating or to-go) and everything will be taken care of, or you can continue to enjoy but we will not be discounting anything tonight\xe2\x80\x9d. '
b'Used to be a waiter at a small diner. Had a couple that acted like this that would come in every few weekends always with the same complaints (food cold, undercooked, etc). Now mind you these kinds of complaints were extremely rare, and they were clearly doing it for free food and were horrible tippers\n\nOne time they made the complaint about ham being \'undercooked\' despite the fact that it was pre-cooked and we just heat it up for them. I took it to the back, cut off a piece and it was very warm and delicious.\n\nWent back to the table and told them the ham was fine, one of them starts throwing a fit and I snapped and said "why don\'t you two get the hell out of here". They left disgusted and cursing me out loudly, and much to my surprise my manager/owner of the restaurant congratulated me when they left! \n\nFuck those people '
b"Was once in a restaurant and at next table a very strange scenario took place.\n\nA clearly well off middle class man (lawyer type) in 30s was having dinner with clearly down and out man about 50 in shabby clothes and poor grooming.  I assumed the second man was a brother or other family member having a tough time.\n\nAs the meal ended, a woman about 50 appeared, also clearly well off middle class, and the middle class man *disappears* with her, leaving the poor guy with the check.\n\nThe restaurant was calm and rather kind but they did ask he come in the next day.  I doubt they would pursued him if he didn't.\n\nJust a weird story that needs telling of someone who got stuck with a check."
b'I had to pay for all my own drinks on my 21st birthday even though I was out with "friends". (aka people I barely knew and/or strangers they brought along because my birthday was on a tuesday and no one wanted to go out) The only drink I didn\'t pay for was a free well shot I got at the second bar we went to because it was my birthday. But every single other drink I had to pay for. It sucked. '
b'Meh, i have had poor friends.\n\nIll take people out to eat, my treat, to celebrate my birthday.\n\nDont want anyone to break their bank because of me '
b'I had a 10 top birthday party one time and nobody asked to get her check so I split it evenly between the other 9. It\xe2\x80\x99s was like 2.25 extra for each of them. I dropped the bills and told them what I had done and they all thanked me for thinking of it \xf0\x9f\x98\x82'
b'Lol my friends made me pay for my bday meal they told me I could pick any place I wanted and they would pay then they ended up picking the place ( very expensive place too mind you ) and I ordered as cheaply as possible thank god because I ended up having to pay for my meal. Guess they just said that for fun '
b'I cannot stand people like this. It\xe2\x80\x99s basically parenting 101. Don\xe2\x80\x99t give in to the toddler\xe2\x80\x99s demands or it just encourages this and worse behavior. People Are basically toddlers these days. \n\nWhen I worked at a family type Italian place, I was walking up to a table and I overheard the guy at the table (he had his back to me) saying \xe2\x80\x9cwatch this, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to get is a free appetizer\xe2\x80\x9d to which I stopped over his shoulder and said \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think we have any free appetizer coupons out right now.\xe2\x80\x9d \n\nHe looked very sheepish and his table looked mortified. Needless to say, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t try to pull any crap and paid for his entire check. Only got a 5% tip, but I expected that from him. '
b"I'm so glad we don't get customers like this because the trash people can't generally afford the place I'm at. It's all very nice rich people and I'm happy with that."
b'Could you go to your manager right off for B trying to get alcohol and get them asked to leave?'
b'I don\xe2\x80\x99t actually give a single shit about birthday girl. She is equally as shitty as the friends she attracts and regardless if it\xe2\x80\x99s your \xe2\x80\x9cspecial day\xe2\x80\x9d no one should ever be that entitled to expect people to take care of you when you don\xe2\x80\x99t come prepared to take care of yourself.  She is young, 18 and all, but there were times where I paid for my own birthday meal and was totally okay with it even at a younger age. The fact that she didn\xe2\x80\x99t tip you is also still not okay and yes, should shift blame on her. '
b"I've witnessed people go both ways, but it really is heartwarming to see them get back on track. I'm sure your kindness when he was down meant a lot to him. "
b'Definitely against the law, with one exception if it is agreed on beforehand. For example when a server is "the bank"(meaning they carry change and accept payment from customers directly), or as part of the employment agreement (if one was signed). That boss sounds like a schiester don\'t let them steal your earnings.'
b'I only had one walk out in my 5 years of serving luckily, but I did not have to pay, nor would I have if requested. It\xe2\x80\x99s illegal and even if it weren\xe2\x80\x99t it\xe2\x80\x99s uncool, that\xe2\x80\x99s why businesses have insurance. \n\nThe only time it did happen to me, I had just dropped off this dudes like $16 check (it was lunch and he had been a little weird the whole time he was there) and while I took his empty dish to the back he split. The two girls sitting at the booth behind him told me they could smell the alcohol on him and that I did everything I could have to prevent that, it was nice of them to back me up to my manager as well. \n\nManagers just voided the check and moved on. '
b'I was doing trivia tonight, we were squeezed into a corner table like 10 minutes before it started. One of the bartenders came up and told us \xe2\x80\x9cthat table closed out but another table wants to grab their table as well, a couple of you should just sit with them now so you\xe2\x80\x99re not fighting over that table.\xe2\x80\x9d \n\nMe and one friend go over and explain the situation. There are three people there ad one of them says \xe2\x80\x9cwell that\xe2\x80\x99s fine but I\xe2\x80\x99m finishing my beer.\xe2\x80\x9d We say that\xe2\x80\x99s fine no rush we\xe2\x80\x99re just chilling here. We start talking to them and the topic of eating ass comes up within 15 seconds. Complete strangers brought up ass eating with us as their first point of conversation.'
b"God bless little old ladies who just don't give a fuck any more"
b'As long as she didn\xe2\x80\x99t offer to show you if hers matched, I\xe2\x80\x99m cool.'
b'This is a little off topic but this reminded me. I\'ve noticed, with my grandmother in particular, that old ladies reach a point where they regress to the point of being almost toddler-like in personality. She\'s a very, very Christian woman, so she\'s never blurted out funny and awkward shit like that, and I love her so much, so the thought of her saying anything even close has me just dying.\n\nMy cousin and his wife and daughter are coming to visit in a few weeks, and my grandmother has had something wrong with her leg (bad Cellulites I think is what my mom said.)\n\nShe\'s been living at an assisted living facility for a while, not a nursing home, so she hasn\'t been able to get to the doctors herself, and she DID NOT want to go, not at all. For a little five foot even ("She\'s hanging onto that inch for dear life" - My dad, Her son.) whispy haired lady with a walker, she\'s the most stubborn person I have ever known. My aunt, my dads sister, finally managed to convince her.\n\n"You don\'t want to be sick when *cousin and his family* are here, do you?"\n\nSo yeah, we now have to convince her to do things like I\'ve had to do with kids when I babysat.'
b"I did that once while bartending at Marriott.  Long story short, took care of a guy and his friend at my bar, then they asked me to brink some food and a bottle of champagne to their room along with their bill, which was $160.  When I got to the room they asked how much they should tip.  I said that any amount was cool, but they kept insisting, so I said fuck it and said $100.  Lo and behold, that's what they wrote in.\n\nOf course, they ended up getting permanently banned from all Marriott properties the next day, so the story had a sad ending for them."
b"When I had dinner with my friends before prom we did something similar. The bill was like $200 and there were like 10 of us I think we each paid way more bc we're great at math. That waitress looked so happy when we left the check with like a 80+ dollar tip. Possibly one of the best things I've ever seen"
b'Meanwhile I have a lady calling my work claiming she left me a $100 bill for her check that I just took and never returned her change for. I wish I had your kind of luck. I\xe2\x80\x99m glad you had a good experience though! They sound like an awesome table to take care of '
b'omg this exact same thing happened to me! A bunch of guys were drinking and sitting and i came by with the check. he asked me how much he should tip me and i kept saying \xe2\x80\x9ci don\xe2\x80\x99t think i\xe2\x80\x99m allowed to say\xe2\x80\x9d and he kept pressing and i just (half) jokingly said $100. hahaha'
b'People will often do this expecting a credit for the next time they order. I work in a locally owned pizza/wings place, and we get calls like this multiple times a week.'
b"Funnily enough one pizza place I like puts on too much pepperoni, like they grab fistfuls and toss it down. Even asking for half amount of pepperoni doesn't change it. "
b'I had someone call and complain that their Ice cream was melted and runny by the time they got home.  "It\'s ridiculous that you would serve something that isn\'t frozen all the way!  Don\'t you know how to work your machine!\'\nMe: "I\'m sorry sir, I can send you a coupon for a free one on your next visit.  What\'s your address?"\nHe gives me his street address, which I don\'t recognize (I grew up here).  \nMe: "OK....Is that here in town? " \nHim: "No it\'s in (city almost 70 miles away)"\nMe: "Ummmm, that\'s an hour drive from here..."\nHim: "So?"\nMe: "It\'s 90 degrees out..."\nHim: "So?"\nMe: "So, Thermo Dynamics states that I\'m not giving you anything free."  And I hung up.\nI love having a boss that hates giving out free food....'
b"That's when you give her olives with a side of the cheese so she can make them herself... Also that sounds terrible"
b"I absolutley despise blue cheese. But give me a garlic clove stuffed olive and I'll be in heaven!"
b'Shit like this always blows me away...\n\nLike when you\'re busy as fuck and someone want\'s the "full fucking experience".. get the fuck out of here. It\'s one thing when you have the time and can hangout.. but when you\'re running around and people get upset that you can\'t cater to something so off the wall and ridiculous, they get butt hurt.\n\nAlways just looking for a reason to be offended.'
b'survive the industry by being able to laugh when stuff like this happens. Someone left a condom as a tip once and I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t stop laughing when I saw because somethings are so ridiculous that you can\xe2\x80\x99t waste time and energy being angry about it. '
b'Yeah I know you meant well. I\xe2\x80\x99ve felt like a dickhead a lot of times when thinking about the whole situation again... It\xe2\x80\x99s okay, shit happens, just try to givz yourself a little bathroom break and analise it all the moment self? I know it\xe2\x80\x99s hard though.'
b'I think you handled it perfectly.\n\nJust because someone says sorry doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean things go back to normal. If someone punches you in the face, then says dirty, you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to be \xe2\x80\x9cokay cool then\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\nThese guys were crass, they were jerks. Yeah, when called out they regretted it (a little bit) but they doesn\xe2\x80\x99t undo the fact they made you feel like crap and did it because they\xe2\x80\x99re in a situation where they have power and you didn\xe2\x80\x99t.\n\nYou don\xe2\x80\x99t have to laugh it off. You did good. You stood up for yourself with quiet dignity. That\xe2\x80\x99s awesome. '
b'As someone who has done this, particularly at coffee places, I swear, I just didn\'t "see" it, even if it\'s right in front of me. I don\'t know what it is, I\'ll see it with my eyes but the brain doesn\'t take that image and go "hey u/illy-chan the menu is *right there*." \n\nFor what it\'s worth, that shit will bother me for hours if not days later. \n\nAt least I always tip well? '
b'As a customer, I struggle very badly with menus (in fast food joints, or any establishment that crafts a menu in size 11 font and hangs it at the top of an 8 foot ceiling, 7 feet back from the counter). My eyesight is not spectacular and they cram so much in one tiny space.  It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to read... and then I get nervous that I\xe2\x80\x99m taking too long...  I can feel the judgement from the cashier and the people behind me... my chest starts to hurt, and I spiral into a fit of anxiety. My life changed when Sheetz and other places started doing the order-ahead-through-an-app deal. '
b'Yeah so get this. \n\nJust last night I had a table of foreigners who wanted to watch the Super Bowl. Despite their excellent grasp of the English language (as speakers) they refused to order off the menu.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe will all take the chicken.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nFine. We, however, have many chicken dishes. They ordered at least one of all of them and some onion rings.\n\nWhen everything came out, they said \xe2\x80\x9cwhy are these all sandwiches?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWell, if you\xe2\x80\x99d read the damn menu, you\xe2\x80\x99d have realized that we are, in fact, a gourmet sandwich and burger place primarily.\n\nEdit: I should add that they tipped 20% despite being from a foreign background stereotypically associated with poor tipping. I guess my service was worth it :-D.'
b'Are the other tips worth it? What are you walking with after a typical shift?'
b"I can't believe the wallet was in his car! Just go get it! "
b"I use Samsung Pay. Sometimes it just doesn't work - that's the nature of computers/bluetooth, etc. I ALWAYS carry my wallet or a card with me, just in case. People are dicks."
b"What makes it even better is that if she hadn't been such a jerk and gave you her ID when her friends did, she would have not had a problem.  Love it when mean people screw themselves over. "
b'> she snapped her fingers at me to get my attention and said "I\'ll have a drink now" and ordered\n\nThis is the point where I would not serve them. God I hate people who treat servers like dogs.'
b'You know what.. I may get downvoted, but fuck it. I never understood this rule. If my ID has my date of birth on it, that is all that should matter. The reason for checking an ID is to make sure the person is OF AGE. If my age is displayed on the ID and is correct, what is the issue? I do agree however that this lady was a major asshole and deserved the "no" she got but I just can\'t wrap my head around the reasoning behind not serving a legally allowed individual just because their ID is expired. '
b'Years ago I was laying down on the couch watching tv and got up too fast to answer the pizza delivery. I started feeling a tad light headed and seeing the telltale spots and vision tunneling that tells me it\'s time to sit the fuck down but was already punching in my PIN so I justkinda pushed through figuring I\'d be fine. \n\nI was not fine lol\n\n\nI came to with him holding a wad of toilet paper to my forehead that he\'d soaked in cold water in the washroom right next to my front door. He was trying to reassure my crying kid that "daddy was going to be fine and to go get mommy". \n\n\nI had already paid and tipped him. He could easily have just left me and gone about his work but instead he stayed to make sure i was alright and spent nearly 20 minutes trying to convince me to let him drop me off at the nearest hospital. \n\n\n"Sir, you need to see a doctor. Do not leave your health in the hands of Allah"\n\n\nI made it a point to call the pizza place and tell his manager how amazing a human being they had hired.\n\n\nFaith in humanity rising...'
b"Surely the accurate response to anyone fainting or collapsing in any way is to either call for someone to help (If appropriate, so in this case a manager), check for breathing, and call the emergency services.\n\nIf the person comes to while I'm calling, then I can judge things then, but I'd rather call an ambulance and have to cancel it than not call one and actually need it."
b"My gut instinct would be to call an ambulance, but  my all too present fear of getting into debt would have me find other alternatives because I wouldn't want the server to be strapped with a several thousand dollar ambulance bill (as an American).  I would be pissed if someone called an ambulance on me and got sent to a hospital when I would rather die since I have enough money for a funeral but not life saving care (yes, I know funerals are deadly expensive)."
b">It gets taxed when entered into the system, and then taxed again when put into our check.\n\nEither you're confused on how that happened, or your employer was stealing from you, cause that's not the way that works."
b'I\xe2\x80\x99m 99.9% sure I used to work for the same exact company. That place was the fucking worst. I remember we had had a contest amongst the servers for who could sell the most of this promotional pumpkin shake... The guy who won (who was an amazing dude) was supposed to get a $500 bonus. When he got it added to his paycheck, the also added an extra gift tax of like 30% and accidentally took that tax from the entire check not just the $500. It took them like 3 months to fix that issue. \n\nThere was also the time the two managers decided to lean back all of the reclinable chairs to pull out all the trash to \xe2\x80\x9clook for silverware\xe2\x80\x9d on a Saturday night, for a sold out theater, 20 minutes before the show started. I was forced to work an extra hour after my shift had ended to help clean the theater. We only found like 5 forks and a few knives in the entire place, and the managers didn\xe2\x80\x99t even help clean up the aftermath.'
b'We\xe2\x80\x99re in the best economy in ages, if the job situation is that bad gtfo, go somewhere else.'
b'As I was cleaning floors one night, I realized one of my customers dropped their phone. We were already closed, they had been gone for a while, so I slipped it in my apron with the intention of handing it into the office when I cashed out. I finished cleaning under my tables. Cashed out. Left. Forgot about the phone in my apron entirely. \nI woke up with three missed calls from my boss, and a text saying to call her right away. \nOh. Crap. \nImmediately she told me the person had tracked their phone to my house. Also immediately, she told me she knows I didn\xe2\x80\x99t steal it on purpose. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t even have to explain what happened. She trusted me. I cannot tell you how many times over the next three years that trust between us came in handy. \nNever work for someone who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t trust you. Especially in a business where money is handled. You can find another restaurant, I promise. '
b'You need to tip your bartender better'
b'1)  Learn as much as you can about the menu, food and drinks, before your interviews.  If one place has a huge wine list, try and learn as much as you can about the wine by the glass.  Whiskey?  Brush up on your bourbon knowledge.  Etc, etc.\n\n2)  Be prepared to be offered a busser job.  Many fine dining places will hire servers who come from your background and make them bussers while training them on fine dining protocol, with the idea of eventually promoting you.'
b"I did 5 years at multiple sportschicken locations and last summer moved to an upscale lodge restaurant, and at the same time broke into seasonal work. It can be done!\n\n\nAlso if you're anti-bussing, lots of upscale places have a cocktail position that's higher volume and less formal, so more relevant to a sports bar vet. That's how I got in and the money is still great. "
b"That's assault brutha."
b'Last time I had a date like that she also insisted on driving. \nTo start we met at a park because "she loves to hike". She barely made it 3 miles total. At that point I went to the bathroom and texted my now ex roomie to pick up my car in half an hour and stay by the phone please. So he used the emergency key to get my car because things were already not adding up. \nWe go to a chain restaurant in a very busy part of town. Being a please and thank you type of person I also watched her reaction which was not a happy one. Sit down order, get dinner and the waitress put her hand on my shoulser whwn she checked up on us. She atarts going off on the waitress about pawing me. I ask her to please stop talking. Of course that baptized the cat. Our waitress shrunk away. She chewed on me for a minute and I asked her to stop talking again.\nTell her the date is over and to not contact me ever again. Told her I will get home on my own. Called for our waitress and apologized for her outrage and paid for my food only with a healthy tip. Walked down to a bar and an hour later had the roomie pick me up. Took me a week to get rid of her, but I dodged a bullet because two years later she was on the news for selling her baby to some local cops for crack.'
b'It\xe2\x80\x99s so sad that she acted that way.  If I was that guy, I\xe2\x80\x99d break up with her because of her attitude.'
b'it\'s really quite sad that she was that insecure and had that little trust in her boyfriend...i\'d prefer my boyfriend to be polite to waitresses rather than rude even of him being rude would "make me feel better"'
b"Dude-run, don't walk, away.  Run.  Don't think, don't ponder, don't consider.  Get up and run away.  Don't look back, don't listen, don't hold the door open for that elderly couple (if they knew your situation they'd be fine).\n\nGet in your car and drive away.  Don't wait, don't unlock all the doors.\n\nWhen you get home take your phone and block her.\n\nBetter yet, throw the phone away and get a new one with a new number.\n\nMove to a different town and change your name.\n\nWait...\n\n...\n\n...OK, that got a little extreme.\n\nBut get away from her as quickly as you can."
b'As my wife says about me. \xe2\x80\x9cKindness, and being polite, are so rare now, most women mistake it flirting\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nI am still kind. \n\nI am still polite. \n\nBut I shut that shit down faster than a manager on Friday locks the doors. \n\n\n\nThis is also why I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I could ever work in a restaurant again.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want my cock, she wants my money, being nice to us is her job.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b"That poor guy better get outta that relationship fast.. they don't get better from there."
b'She threw a plate at you !? My your self control I would have called the cops on her and made her wait. I hope the guy gave her a piece of his mind afterwards but she would probably think he just wanted to go back to flirt with you. '
b"Fuck I've been flirting with waitresses people who hold open doors and people who pick up my pencil when i drop it near them. This sure is an eye opener "
b"My friends often tell me I'm always flirting with the waitresses, while all I'm doing is just ordering in a polite way and ask how they're shift has been so far. It's really just decency and would be nice if more people did it. "
b'Oh yeah ours does too. It\xe2\x80\x99s a fake little small one just enough that boys and my creepy ex who just started back will stop annoying me '
b'This happens so often, but my name is a biblical name, but not very popular, so people get it wrong all the time. When they tell my hostesses or servers they know the owner and then don\xe2\x80\x99t even get my name right, they can\xe2\x80\x99t help but laugh. I basically live at that restaurant, to pretend you know me better than my staff, whom I spend most waking minutes with, is laughable. '
b'I have a buddy that owns a pasta joint...and god damn, is it fucking AMAZING. They make the pasta fresh every day and the sauces used are made to order. I was sitting at the bar one night when they were really busy when the table directly behind me had a problem with something, I can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine what the problem was and I didn\xe2\x80\x99t overhear that part, but they were so busy that my friend was serving them himself to ease some strain on the wait staff. They demanded to speak to the owner and when he informed the guy that he WAS in fact the owner, his wife doubled down. She informed him she knew the owner as she ate there twice a week and it was not him and if he didn\xe2\x80\x99t fetch said owner right now, she\xe2\x80\x99d have him fired. She knew his first AND his last name and just flat refused to admit he was standing right in front of her. \n\nIt must be a mental disorder or something. I can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine what happens in the brains of these people that just will not allow them to admit defeat. '
b'I went out last night to a fantastic Italian restaurant that had the best bread I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever had. So warm and fresh and buttery. Obviously our table devoured it, so I asked if we could get more to eat with our entrees. The waitress seemed so pissed, as if no one ever asked this before. We got three pieces of cold bread to teach us a lesson I guess. Note to restaurants that serve amazing bread, don\xe2\x80\x99t act put off if people eat it all! '
b'I worked at a place and the owner\xe2\x80\x99s name was Jody (he was a guy) and you could always tell when people were trying to name drop for a discount cause they\xe2\x80\x99d say shit like \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m friends with Jody, she always gives me 20% off.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b"Good for you. It's like when voldermorts spell bounced back and fucked his shit up. Thousands of servers all over the country just raised a glass. Cause you would've gotten the fuck fired in a corporate place. But I'm glad you didn't. Fuck that bitch"
b'I feel like there needs to be a yearly thing that means that hospitality workers can say what ever they want to customers one day a year without the possibility of being fired.\n\nOr maybe just give everyone a \xe2\x80\x98ticket\xe2\x80\x99 they can cash once yearly to fly off the handle.\n\nWould be good for the soul.'
b"Condolences, brother. If you get fired, you left on the highest of notes: defending yourself and your personhood. I know NOLA well (used to, at least) and I'm sure there are a lot of good managers and owners out there who will hire you not just despite of that, but because of it. From experience: either way, if you got a few bucks saved up, just take some me time if you can. Don't drink yourself into a hole. Loss is fucking awful enough without it. Much love man. \n\nP.S. Fuck this SB, Who Dat"
b'What a horrible human being. I\'m glad you stood up for yourself, and am SO sorry about your grandmother. \n\nI just can\'t get over this apparently prevalent "off with their heads!!" mentality so many people seem to have these days. No one deserves to lose their job off one apparently failed interaction, ffs.\n\nAgain, way to go in standing up for yourself!'
b"Haven't even read the other comments because I'm raging over this. My grandpa is on home hospice, about to die. I'm so sorry you have to deal with these fucking stupid excuses for people while you're mourning. Fuck that bitch.\n\nMuch love, OP."
b'Its one thing to stiff you with no tip but to write down lazy asshole fire him on the recipet especially after what you been through. Anyone would have snapped at that situation.'
b'When you work at a touristy place here they\xe2\x80\x99ve gotta give you one free snap, people can be unbearable and ridiculous. I had a table hit on me nonstop and treat me like an object all night then they didn\xe2\x80\x99t tip (last night, that\xe2\x80\x99s by far not the worst that\xe2\x80\x99s happened to me here.)'
b"Speaking from a customer's perspective, people like this are the scum of the earth. I don't believe in Heaven but what I do believe is that there's an extra-special place in Hell for these kind of people. Fuck that woman. \n\nSorry for the loss of your loved one, OP. Good on you for putting this piece of shit in her place."
b'Who the fuck makes a check mark in the air to indicate they want their check? \n\nFucking no one. \n\nWhat a twat. \n\nI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry about your gram, OP. My condolences \xf0\x9f\x92\x99'
b'You know what the best of this was? You went straight to your manager to "confess your sins". We take so much nonsense bullshit in the service industry, and clearly you give a damn about your job. \n\nI\'m sorry that you\'ve had a rough go lately. Don\'t let it weigh on you.'
b'I bet you feel good though yelling at that person. Even if you end up fired, fuck her! '
b"I don't get it. I've waited an hour for my check. I've had crappy service and crappy food. I've gotten the wrong food, items missing, requests forgotten. It doesn't matter. 20% tip, no comments, no angry Yelp reviews. I'm not a restaurant critic. It's not my job to judge other human beings who are without a doubt working harder than me for less money. We share this tiny miserable planet and most of our DNA. Finish your jalape\xc3\xb1o poppers, pay up, and go home."
b'Sorry bout ya grandma dude. Fuck that bitch writing that on the check and a zero tip she left. Fuck em! Keep ya head up!'
b'You both sound like shitty entitled assholes. The only problem is YOU were at work, and should maintain some semblance of professionalism. You admitted to messing up. You took a long smoke break while you had a table waiting, that\xe2\x80\x99s not cool. You said it was because of \xe2\x80\x9cthe vibe\xe2\x80\x9d well you were wrong, maybe skipping you on a top was wrong, but you had already messed up first. \n\nAt the sake of sounding heartless, your grandmother died, and I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. However, no one really cares. If you were distraught, then stay home. If not, leave that shit at the door when you walk in. You\xe2\x80\x99re making your problems other people\xe2\x80\x99s problem, that\xe2\x80\x99s not cool. Especially at a bar, where people go to unwind.\n\nSo yeah. As someone else said, maybe you shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be a server. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem like a good fit for you, or learn to suck it up. '
b"Honestly dude you're in the wrong here. I get that maybe she got her signs messed up, not your fault- but fuck man your reaction is fucking childish. I would definitely want you fired, I don't doubt that other outbursts happen as well. \n\nGet a grip it's a $34 check you entitled baby."
b'So sorry for your loss! The shift after my grandmother passed I cried in the walk-in for twenty minutes after a customer was a little rude. So props for keeping your shit together enough to enact a sweet comeback. I would give anything to see the look on her face when that receipt hit her '
b'10 minutes isn\xe2\x80\x99t horrible, but I have had situations where no only will it take 10 minutes to bring the check, it takes 10 minutes to pick it up with the card and another 10 minutes to run it through the system so I can leave. All while I am occupying an entire table at lunch rush- as I see people waiting for a table. That made me want to reduce the tip on an already bad service. 0$ tip is inexcusable however '
b'I\xe2\x80\x99m so sorry you\xe2\x80\x99re having such a rough week, man! It was very therapeutic hearing about how this went down!! Lol I felt like I got to scream at that lady what I\xe2\x80\x99ve wanted to say to a few people the last few weeks, so thanks! '
b'A pro server would already have a check made during the closing/end of their time. If they add a Sri m no big deal, grab another.  But that way you\xe2\x80\x99d have had it on you. '
b'I was just in NOLA this weekend with a large group of friends for a bachelor/bachelorette combo. That city is crazy, good and bad. I had the pleasure of listening to chicken on the bone in some bar on Saturday night and the bartenders there are so nice! they gave me free orange slices and cherries to snack on. 10/10 best part of my trip. '
b"As someone who gets really annoyed by servers who leave us hanging (it happens a lot in Canada, customer service is very different here compared to the USA) I would never write something like that on a bill or suggest someone get fired over it (unless it was a repeat thing, but obviously customer doesn't usually know that).\n\nShe was a drunk asshole and she deserved the telling off even if it was your fault. A response needs to be proportional. You don't call someone a lazy asshole and suggest firing over something like that. She escalated the situation from a misunderstanding/mistake."
b"So you weren't post shift ignored a table like you were and then assaulted someone and you think you did a good job and deserved a tip"
b' Sorry about your home  troubles . Maybe take a day and relax a bit .  You really should Quit smoking tho , (it\xe2\x80\x99s good for you ) ...Customers are always assholes always were and always will be ...use the experience To remind you that the slightest thing can turn into an avalanche of shit.for you and the customer .please .... for gobs sake please  pay attention to your physical health!!!!\n\n.The daily grind of the restaurant industry can Erode your physical and mental well-being. \nGood luck  maybe that freak out  was a pressure release .I hope it gets better from here . '
b'So you go to smoke for a time you admit is longer than necessary before you are about to close. A woman who is done eating signals to you and you misunderstand, seems pretty obvious given you\xe2\x80\x99re about to close and they\xe2\x80\x99re done eating. I would also be pissed if you come back 15 minutes later smelling like cigarettes. \n  \nCan tell you\xe2\x80\x99re a sensitive guy with a victim complex. Only difference between me and the lady is you\xe2\x80\x99d be on your ass if you pulled that shit on me. Although we all know a scrawny pussy like you would only dare try it on a woman\n\nIf you can\xe2\x80\x99t control your emotions because of personal reason don\xe2\x80\x99t go to work buddy.'
b'So next time just seat the table and get them waters for their few minutes wait, then their happy and so is your server'
b'As a once host, and now server, at this particular Australian steakhouse. I know it is the policy to seat the customers, to avoid the \xe2\x80\x9cfalse wait\xe2\x80\x9d and help the server in taking care of them. It is your job to make sure they are sat. And I also know that servers are not allowed to approach the host stand to complain. If that happens you should get a manager. Do your job and you\xe2\x80\x99ll get better reviews \xf0\x9f\xa4\xb7\xf0\x9f\x8f\xbb\xe2\x80\x8d\xe2\x99\x82\xef\xb8\x8f'
b'I tend to get stupidly and embarrassingly involved in sporting events, which is why I tend to watch them at home, with a small circle of friends: I want to *minimize* the amount of witnesses to my sports-watching behaviour.\n\nMy thoughts and prayers go out to all of the brave industry folks working last night...'
b'Unless the kid looked cis female I would assume the woman was just mentally tired and accidentally said "she" when "he" was meant; my mother has accidentally called me by my brother and sister\'s name.  If not, good on the mother for not fighting it because 12 is the start of pubescents and is extremely confusing for both sexes; I do stop my acceptance when parents give children hormone blockers at the start of pubescents.'
b"Now that's really fresh take on getting rid of unwanted employees: Poison them and then use their being poisoned as reason to fire them. Ingenious. I've read about a manager having someone shot to avoid their taking business secrets with them (and avoiding to pay the agreed termination bonus), this is right on par with it. What will come next? Slaugther them and use them for long pig cutlets and ribs?"
b"That wasn't the reason she was let go.  It was just really good timing."
b"As someone with celiac I think they completely understood what you were saying, it's highly likely that he was getting something gluten free also so that there was no contamination between him and his wife, either so they could share food/drinks without having to worry, or in case he forgets to brush his teeth/rinse his mouth before next kissing her. At that point he probably wasn't asking because they were worried about contamination in the kitchen"
b'This is why I am so hesitate to go out. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been told to my face that since I have celiacs I should not go out to eat. \n\nSo people allergic to seafood shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t either? \n\nI\xe2\x80\x99m not saying you didn\xe2\x80\x99t do above and beyond your job as a server. I\xe2\x80\x99m saying that the attitude needs to change. They obviously are trying to fit your restaurant into their \xe2\x80\x9capproved and safe list\xe2\x80\x9d (I have one too) and everyone that is gluten free is different. Depending on the symptoms they get after contamination, they may have some slack in procedures. Anyone that has a severe reaction will NOT eat at your place if they had a healthy dose of common sense.\n\nI have actively avoided places where I felt the management, kitchen, and servers made me feel awkward or annoying when I was ordering; my allergy is more on the side of digestive issues so I can risk contamination in order to have a nice night out with my family so that\xe2\x80\x99s the only reason I even try.\n\nPlease remember to be patient and understanding. Their diagnosis could also be fairly new and cravings happen to EVERYONE. '
b'Wow, that was just amazing !!! I literally burst out laughing \xf0\x9f\x98\x82   '
b"I did not know racism was such an issue in Sweden. I am in the US and as we all know it's huge here, but I thought Sweden was bigger and better than that. I guess not \xf0\x9f\x98\xa0"
b'Had 7 tables come in at 4:30-5pm and I was the only server...usually no one comes in during those hours so I was surprised but my restaurant does the tips at the end of the night and I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how much I made yet so hopefully it will be good '
b"Haha so awesome. The best part is if she had just done it to begin with, she wouldn't have had a problem because her license wouldn't have been expired!"
b"The next time they announce a contest ask if they're gonna actually honor it at the end or if they're going to cop out to save money"
b'Systems go down, you guys need a backup.  Either get your owners to get a knuckle buster (imprinter) or have a backup square reader.  Comping a $450 check cost them more than having a simple prepaid smartphone in the office that can run as a backup processor.'
b"I'm so glad that it worked out for you in the end!\n\nWe had our entire POS system go down on a Friday night in a busy two-floored restaurant. On the top floor, it was only me and one other server with one bartender, because TWO people had called out sick. It was a perfect storm for disaster. \n\nWe begged our managers to at least close it down to one floor, so that the damage was contained to one area. Also, the top floor had to run hand-written tickets all the way downstairs to the kitchen, and that was eating up a lot of time. And our kitchen is not really equipped for hand-written tickets, so ticket times were like 40 minutes at least. You would think it would be the same idea, but it was really confusing for everyone. \n\nThey finally agreed, but not before my one coworker and I got our sections completely sat with huge parties. Thanks. "
b"10 years ago that would have been a non issue. A waiter way back then would have had skills like memory and arithmatic to use ancient tech called pen and paper to manually write a bill for the meals......\n\nOhh wait don't most places owned by Asian and Scottish  people still run that way to cook the books...."
b"I had a busy night last night, 200 reservations on the books, the last weekend of a city-wide restaurant promo, plus it was the first decently liveable day since the polar vortex.\n\nA couple at the bar were asking me questions about the restaurant. Eventually they asked if this was a reservation type of place or if they could just walk in? Definitely reservations. Do we have a table for 4 tonight at 830? I told him the chances were slim but I'd check.\n\nThey were in luck! We had a cancellation of 4 at 8:30. I just needed to put it in right then to secure it. They aren't sure. The clock is ticking, I tell them. Someone could snatch up that spot any second calling, walking up, or online. They still don't know. 10 minutes later they finally give me a name and tell me to book it. I drop what I'm doing and rush up to the host stand. The spot already got booked online. Stupid guests: [surprised Pikachu face]"
b'My husband is Colombian and I was a server when we met. He admitted he didn\xe2\x80\x99t tip well when first moved to the states. I used to bitch about customers like that to him for hours HOURS after work. He tips 30% every time we go out now and always makes a reservation.  '
b'It was interesting to see a post from a manager! Usually it\xe2\x80\x99s the servers, bartenders etc...you seem like a pretty cool person to work for. Glad to know there are still places that the manager has the employees backs and understands the mind numbing hell from ignorant customers we have to deal with on the regular. \xf0\x9f\x92\xaa\xf0\x9f\x8f\xbc '

b"I felt so at ease in Ireland, as if I had lived there before (I haven't). There is no pretentiousness in Ireland that I ever saw. Down-to-earth people who try hard to not offend anyone and work harder to put you at ease - often at their own expense, and even if you're an obnoxious American. The scenic beauty and uniqueness of each area is unlike any other I have found in the world. Their history is so diverse and fascinating- seems like each county could write their own history book, and everywhere you turn, there's a castle in front of you! I could go on and on."
b'Last weekend, there was a game, at the arena next to the restaurant I work in. At 2 pm. So I got there at 11am for pre rush. We slowed a bit when the game started the manager/owner informed us there is a pre booked party in our party room, for 30 people. He chose the server, off he went to set up. We had 2 bands playing, other reservations, and the inevitable after game rush. We get through after game rush, no issues, it\xe2\x80\x99s almost time for that party show up, we help him set up. After game rush slows down, cuts are made all good. (I should add that due to the flu going around the staff, I had worked every day up until that, mostly doubles. That morning I clocked IN with 63 hours. I was tired) then it starts filling up again, I have the bar area, no end in sight. As soon as I get up clean they are turning. I had the 16 seats at the bar, and 7 booths on the bar side. Everything was sat, and I was making drinks for the severs as well. If I say I was in the weeds. I\xe2\x80\x99m talking the weeds in a swamp that\xe2\x80\x99s filled with gators!!!!!! This crowd was a bit trashy. I was keeping my head above water and just trying to keep my mind in the end result. Then I get a table of rednecks that are whistling, banging on the table. So I got their beers moved on then they start yelling, about it taking so long. That is another story though. Back to this 30 person party. They start trickling in. The servers are over it, so the ship is sinking, both the managers are in the kitchen, and I am doing anything and everything I can to not only do my job, but help everyone else. All of a sudden there are very angry people at the bar saying \xe2\x80\x9cyou need to go downstairs and help him, we reserved that room, and we can\xe2\x80\x99t get service.\xe2\x80\x9d I literally looked around, I had sever tickets so long they looked like a cvs receipt! I laughed. I said ma\xe2\x80\x99am I am very sorry, you can order food here I can get what you need but since it\xe2\x80\x99s all separate tickets you have to wait up here, I can NOt leave this area, to come find you. I was very nice. This girl orders food and disappears. I had a second so I went to find her. I walk downstairs and there were 60+ people. They more than DOUbLeD the amount of people!!!!!!!!!!!! And they were mad at us! They kept yelling at me. The owners wife was in there with her friends and she sees this and she goes downstairs IN HEAL. Running food and drinks and getting things. We did the best we could (all while another 49 top rolled in off the street.) had 25 glasses out and was making shots. The woman from the party downstairs comes up to me AGAIN and tells me I have to come down and help him, she said \xe2\x80\x9c your not even that busy.\xe2\x80\x9d I literally have 5 shaker tins and I am making shots and still have full bar and 5-7 people sitting at my seven booths and server tickets. I looked at her with a smile and said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m so sorry I can\xe2\x80\x99t come downstairs we are doing everything we can\xe2\x80\x9d she says \xe2\x80\x9cyou are ruining my gender reveal\xe2\x80\x9d I said \xe2\x80\x9cyou have 60+people at your gender reveal?. Wow.\xe2\x80\x9d  The server that was working that party was doing the best he could. He was splitting up checks most, and everyone was yelling at him. A bunch of stuff gets discounted. Finally it\xe2\x80\x99s time for them to leave. They start yelling at the owner and his wife and the manager. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how he kept his cool. He really is a saint. Standing there getting chewed out. Finally he very calmly says. \xe2\x80\x9cMa\xe2\x80\x99am, you booked a party, off menu, for 30 people. I am sorry that we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t accommodate the extra 30+ people. That\xe2\x80\x99s why I book these things in advance. I discounted most all the tabs I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.\xe2\x80\x9d And that was that. These women stood there talking shit. The messed up thing is. He was in the kitchen with the GM because they needed to be able to make all that food. We did everything we could have. I have been doing this for 10 years and the money was GREAt that day. But I worked from 11am-2am I have never seen so many things go wrong in one day. How are you going to book a party and double it, and not tell anyone. Sorry we can\xe2\x80\x99t pull extra servers out of our ass on a Saturday 30 minutes after the party starts. And WHO needs that many people at a gender reveal? '
b'It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t even my party, I was already serving 60+ people by my self,  while making server drinks, running food and doing everything I could (short if cloning my self) to help with the party, and helping the other servers that were on the dining side of the restaurant. I have a system, I\xe2\x80\x99m not Superman but if I stay organized I can handle A LOT. I\xe2\x80\x99m still only one person. I  was never rude (though I come from a family of lawyers and teachers, so I can sometimes tell people they are stupid in a way that they don\xe2\x80\x99t understand, and once people start trying to negotiate with me they very quickly realize that they will loose). That being said. The business comes first, I love my job, and my coworkers. I also understand that, just because it\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cnot my table\xe2\x80\x9d doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t affect my money. Since I am set up on the bar side and I am the Bar tender, everyone can constantly see me, so if I have a stack of tickets in my hand and I\xe2\x80\x99m taking bar orders while making sever drinks and helping do multiple ALL of my tables can see that I am working my ass off. What some people don\xe2\x80\x99t understand is that. When patrons see everyone helping each other and working together they usually tip everyone better. They also come back. Delete business is how we all make our money. The biggest issue with that party is everyone there was bending over backwards and they just wanted free shit and couldn\xe2\x80\x99t understand why doubling a party that size would be an issue on a Saturday night. They also got on FB, and continuously commented, and they contacted the BBB I work for a mom and pop, we have generations and a few franchises but I work for the big guy, the flagship. They have a more than solid clientele base, so their reviews won\xe2\x80\x99t hurt us. It still makes me mad, that someone would go after the little guy, and try to hurt someone\xe2\x80\x99s livelihood. '
b'Sounds like that marriage will last.'
b'Rim the glass in Old Bay and swap in Absolut Peppar vodka. Delicious.\n\nIf your guests want a twist on the flavor, sub in Hendricks gin or Mezcal for the vodka.'
b'Let\xe2\x80\x99s be optimistic and say that a server has 4 tables in their assigned section, and that each one ends up with a $100 total bill; in a magic occurrence each one tips 20%. Server earns $80 on a 7 hour shift, has to tip out bartenders and bussers, leaves with $60. Pretty bad day for the server, and that\xe2\x80\x99s best-case. \n\nThe table you filled could probably have been seated 6 times in that 7 hours. Even at a miserable $5 tip per table, that\xe2\x80\x99s $30 in tips, or 50% more than they\xe2\x80\x99d get from the 7 hour camper. \n\nSo my advice is, if you camp out for 7 hours on a table, order enough food/drinks to be equivalent to 6 sets of customers and tip accordingly, or else leave a way bigger tip % than you usually would. '
b'I worked that Sunday as a favor to my boss at a popular wing restaurant. Most of my section was already full when I arrived and left a 6 hour shift with $20.  That was my last favor. '
b'We do it all the time (in Canada) go early to get a table, maybe have a few rounds of drinks then eat supper while watching the game. It\xe2\x80\x99s fine.'
b'Let me give you some advice.  Never tell a guest they are cut off.  Let your manager handle that for you.  They are paid the big bucks to be a buffer between you and potentially hostile guests.'
b'Cutting people off can be tricky, and I don\'t like doing it either because you never know how it\'s gonna go.  Usually people know they are drunk and take it pretty good, but you always get the chance that it\'s gonna backfire.  Funny enough i always have the most trouble with middle aged ladies lol.  For some reason they think they are entitled and the world owes them a favor.\n\nIf they order a drink, i usually just say "I can\'t do any booze right now, but i can get you a pop or water and see how it goes"  If they bitch and moan i just tell them it\'s the law, and out of my hands.  Just be firm, tell them that\'s the law, and walk away.  They can piss and moan all they want amongst themselves, but i\'m not gonna sit there and argue with them when I\'m not gonna change my mind.  If they have a problem with it they can leave and come back another time when they aren\'t so tipsy.\n\nDon\'t feel bad.  You don\'t have control how other people are gonna react.  You are doing your job and I commend you for it.  Also, they should feel ashamed that they are giving someone 15 years there junior shit for literally just doing their job.  If they were mature 35 year olds they wouldn\'t have gotten so smashed in the first place.\n\nDon\'t fret.  I used to be like you and would get upset when people got mad at me but you learn with experience that there is fuck all you can do.  Let them react, but try not to take it personally :)'
b"I have been doing this for quite a while and not once has this ever gone well for me and many people I've worked with over the years. Most people are going to lose their shit about this one.\n\nYou did exactly what you're supposed to but if you ever feel uncomfortable about doing this again just go to your manager first when you realize they've had too much to drink."
b"Spoiled entitled brats. I despise the fools that come out with the 'who you you think you are' or 'who are you talking to' nonsense. Especially by what are known as chavs in Britain "
b'There was a horrible DUI crash on I-75 in/around Lexington KY killing a family of 5 and the intoxicated driver. A local bar kept giving him drinks despite him being intoxicated. His blood alcohol level was .3 something.\n\nNow that bar is in legal jeopardy. This JUST happened. \n\nSo thank you for not serving already drunk customers. '
b"Not a server, but if I had to tell someone they were cut off, I'd offer an alternative if they wish to dispute my decision.\n\n...Which would be offering to call the police to do a field sobriety test on them.\n"
b'I used to manage a couple of restaurants for a large chain in the Midwest. I trained my staff, so I backed my staff. One day one of the waitresses came to me and asked me to refuse service. She thought they were too drunk to order. If she thought so, I sure as hell thought so. I went to the table, apologised politely for not being able to serve them, but offered soft drink alternatives. They got pissed off, as I expected, and huffed out of the restaurant. About 3 miles down the road, they flipped their car and totalled it. Had we served them, we would have been culpable. I have never forgotten it, and used it to support my staff ever after.'
b'We have super strict laws here in Aus, too. I avoid using the words \xe2\x80\x9ccut off\xe2\x80\x9d at all costs. When people are that drunk, offer them food or water when they ask for a drink (make it sound fun - \xe2\x80\x9csomething special\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cyou must be starving! Do you want a drink first?\xe2\x80\x9d) they\xe2\x80\x99re really susceptible to suggestion, so use that. \n\nMy favourite thing to do, if they\xe2\x80\x99re happy drunk, is to make them a deal. We\xe2\x80\x99re having fun, laughing, chatting, and when they ask for a drink I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell them \xe2\x80\x9chaha maaaaybe! But you\xe2\x80\x99ve gotta do me a favour. You\xe2\x80\x99ve got to drink a water first.\xe2\x80\x9d  Generally that works, and they will, and then they\xe2\x80\x99ll forget they\xe2\x80\x99ve asked for a drink. Or if they still want one and they\xe2\x80\x99re not *too* drunk, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell them they\xe2\x80\x99ve gotta order food or else I won\xe2\x80\x99t be able to get them their drink. '
b'I work at a dive bar in my town and constantly am having to cut people off, probably at least one customer a night. It never goes well, they always argue. I also run into the problem of being much younger than most of my customers. I make sure to be as firm as possible without being rude and I never entertain an argument with the customer. Once you entertain an argument the situation always gets messy from there! '
b'I don\'t understand customers losing their minds over what table they have. Who cares? We got an Open Table complaint because someone got a table instead of a booth and "you go to a restaurant to be pampered". We have a couple who claims our manager "purposely" gave THEIR table away. '
b'Where I work we like to keep a running joke throughout the day. We find something on a weird ticket or something someone said (something not personal of course) and go with it.\n\n\nFor example, one of the cashiers rang up an order with a special instruction "One peace of chicken". Obviously she meant to say piece, but instead whenever we said "Piece" throughout the day we would throw up a peace sign to whoever we were talking to.\n\n\nA good sense of humor definitely makes it easier when you\'re twelve tickets in the weeds and it helps not want to murder your co-workers. '
b'We just had a wine contest. Our wine sales were down, so to encourage more wine sales, they gave away a 40" smart TV to whoever could sell the most, plus a $50 gift card to the restaurant. Second place got a $20 gift card.'
b'If the child is below the age of four, I usually just make eye contact, smile and wave at them. If they\xe2\x80\x99re drawing something on our coloring sheets, sometimes I\xe2\x80\x99ll say something like \xe2\x80\x9coooh I like your drawing\xe2\x80\x9d while cleaning up their table and they usually smile, thank me and continue on. They\xe2\x80\x99re so young that there\xe2\x80\x99s only so much (appropriate) communicating that you can do, so don\xe2\x80\x99t feel pressured to do anything. If they\xe2\x80\x99re older though (like between the ages of 4 and 8) I\xe2\x80\x99ll usually ask them what they\xe2\x80\x99d like to order in a softer tone while making frequent eye contact with the parent(s) and quietly asking or mouthing \xe2\x80\x9cis that okay?\xe2\x80\x9d When they order something. Also don\xe2\x80\x99t offer kids anything; always ask the parent what they want their kid to have. If you ask a kid if they want chocolate milk, they\xe2\x80\x99re usually going to say yes even when the parent says no and suddenly you have a tantrum on your hands. I think the sticker idea is cute, maybe just carry them around in your pocket or apron if you have one and offer them to kids when they\xe2\x80\x99re being well behaved. I also work in a daycare though, so I\xe2\x80\x99ve kind of learned how to treat kids when you\xe2\x80\x99re experiencing professional relationships (like serving them as a family) and when you\xe2\x80\x99re experiencing more personal ones, like being their teacher and daily provider. You\xe2\x80\x99ll get the hang of it.'
b'As tourist season is ramping up in my area AND being only 90 minutes or so away from the Orlando parks we get to deal with questions almost on a daily basis in which the answers are:  NO we haven\'t any idea what any of the parks opening and closing times are, No we haven\'t any idea about any of the rides or attractions, No we have no idea what exit to take,  NO we don\'t know how to get to your hotel or what it is like,  NO we can\'t recommend any restaurants as no one here has been to the area in years let alone know the phone numbers and locations, NO we don\'t know what the Uber/Lyft situation is like there or any other mode of transportation.  \n\nMost people take this in stride as we do not answer them with any attitude, just a simple "Sorry can\'t help you but if you go across the bridge (about a mile) there is a tourist information center on the right.  They have all of that info."  \n\nThe rest are OUTRAGED we can not help them \'cause you know they need the info NOW!! How dare we not know this information.  We should know everything about everything in that area because we live here.  BTW we are very happy to live HERE and not THERE. '
b'>no worries sir, as soon as the dinner rush is over I\xe2\x80\x99ll try and go fuck my self\n\nTry? Try?!?\xe2\x80\x99 TRY?!?!?!\n\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s not good enough!!! YOU WILL GO FUCK YOURSELF!!!!\n\nRofl sorry, couldn\xe2\x80\x99t resist. In all seriousness I fucking love your manager. That was smart arsery at its best'
b'"I am very sorry sir and I do not necessarily agree with the prices that have been set but does it really (fucking) look like I control anything around here? And before you ask, no I will not give you a discount because while i hate this job I need the money. Thanks"\n\n\\- Me, verbatim'
b'The place that I work, out while system went down. From the sodas being hooked up, to the dispenser. Luckily there was a liquor store right next door to us, we had to take turns going over there to buy a few two liters of sodas everytime we ran out. XD'
b'Yes, tell the general manager. Threatening a write-up for just saying \xe2\x80\x9cNo, I can\xe2\x80\x99t do that\xe2\x80\x9d is poor management.\n\nEdit: If you don\xe2\x80\x99t feel comfortable with that, talk to the GM and see if it\xe2\x80\x99s possible to have shifts (without it seriously penalizing your hours) when this particular manager isn\xe2\x80\x99t working because you two don\xe2\x80\x99t get along and you don\xe2\x80\x99t think you can give good service with him present.'
b'Aw, they\xe2\x80\x99re just trying to flex. And failed at it, because you were in the right. \n\nWhaaaat you\xe2\x80\x99re a person with autonomy \n\nI once had a GM at a corporate \xe2\x80\x9cfine dining\xe2\x80\x9d place I was working tell me to go deal with an overflowing, clogged toilet, on the other side of a 200 seat dining room, in the middle of dinner service, *when I was working expo and food running.* Rather than give him a \xe2\x80\x9cWhat the fuck?\xe2\x80\x9d response, I was very curtly like \xe2\x80\x9cNo. I am busy running food. I am hear to handle food, not toilets. I suggest you ask one of the dishwashers or busboys who have to touch dirty stuff to take care of it.\xe2\x80\x9d \n\nThe head chef started cracking up, she hated this new GM. Rather than huff and puff he just sort of looked through me, found the next body, which was a pots and pans dishwasher, and asked him. Somehow that was more upsetting to me than if I had actually upset him. \n\nShortly thereafter this GM was fired for stealing tips off the top. Dudes making 65k a year or whatever and skimming bucks from servers smh. \n\nEdit: additionally it was a pair of shit-stained underwear that someone tried to flush down the toilet\xe2\x80\x94not relevant to your post but hilarious nonetheless '
b">This manager has gotten on my nerves every time I have worked with him and it's making me irritated and starting to make me want to find somewhere else to work, which I don't want to, I love my job and it's always bad managers who make me want to quit.\n\nI've learned with managers with this you just tell them whatever they need to hear then go right back to what you are doing."
b"Document this. Use neutral language. (Nothing emotional. Describe it in a very detached way like an anthropologist would) State the date, times as close as possible.\n\nIts a CYA thing. Not just here but for future incidents. If this keeps up or escalates, you'll want a record showing your side.\n\n\n\n"
b'That\xe2\x80\x99s just bad management. If someone on my staff were to say that to me, I would much rather grab the drinks myself and eventually find someone to take the table, then force them to give bad service and leave them overwhelmed and frustrated. Also, you\xe2\x80\x99re a person (not a robot who takes orders) who is allowed to be frustrated. I hope the rest of your management team supports you in expressing yourself. '
b"Someone else put it best:\n\n> Glitter is the herpes of the crafts world, it won't go away.\n\nGood luck with getting the glitter off of your floor. That alone should have required an additional gratuity of at least 10%."
b"The co worker better have said something to you afterwards. Otherwise fuck them you're supposed to be a team. \n\nMust be cool working at a casino tho? Maybe I'm clutching at straws I dunno"
b'What kind of total loser are you to put down a  waitress like that? Kudos to you for keeping your cool.'
b'I like to tip with chips because it\xe2\x80\x99s more convenient, I usually don\xe2\x80\x99t carry a lot of cash with me when I\xe2\x80\x99m at the casinos. I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure which is preferred, but  I always end up tipping the waitress a $5 chip, instead of a $1 bill. '
b'"Sorry boss, I locked my keys in my car. I can\'t do anything until after my shift. '
b'IDK why people are so content to piss off the person making their food?  Do they have a death wish?'
b"That's so petty it blows my mind."
b'I once was clearing empty beer glasses and reached to far and emptied the tray into the table  (party of six I believe). Glass shattered everywhere and even cascaded into a couple purses that were on the ground. \n\nI froze and just repeated I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry over and over and the one woman just grabbed my arm and said \xe2\x80\x9cstop apologizing, it\xe2\x80\x99s okay, just grab a broom\xe2\x80\x9d. I cleaned up, got them a round and the night went on like nothing happened. I was so grateful and appreciative. \n\nIt was not uncommon at my place of work for people to try and take advantage of little mistakes, let alone big ones. '
b'A server once dropped an entire tray of 12 mimosas on my fiance\'s grandma and aunt on the grandma\'s birthday. Every year we always joke about the year she got a champagne shower on her birthday. \n\n\nThe only drink I\'ve ever spilled on someone was a Caesar on a woman who was (very unfortunately) wearing a white skirt. She knocked my hand as I was setting it down and it spilled right toward her. A couple months after that a coworker is carrying drinks to her table on a tray. One of the customers at the table decides not to wait for her to sent down his beer so he grabs his beer off her tray. She wasn\'t a very seasoned waitress (still isn\'t, honestly) and can\'t rebalance the tray (which is hard for seasoned servers even because we\'re not expecting the weight to suddenly change) and ends up spilling the remaining drinks all over him and his wife. He was not happy but I hope he learned never to do that again. \n\n\nOne of my biggest pet peeves is customers who stop you while your hands are full or you\'re carrying a full tray. In December I had my hands completely full with plates from a table I had just bussed. The plate on top was covered in whipped cream and a customer stops me on my way into the kitchen. She literally walked into my path to ask me a question and the top plate ended up sliding off and landed right next to her foot. Whipped cream all over her shoe. I felt bad and I helped her clean it off but it was also definitely a "you brought this on yourself" kind of moment. '
b'Holy shit, what a kind lady!! Stories like this help me go to work feeling positive. '
b'I had a friend who was a fantastic server but lost a tray off her shoulder at The Pepper Yard. A lasagna fell all down this woman\xe2\x80\x99s chest- fresh from the melt. I was in our break room (SMOKING- this was so long ago) and could see her section from my seat. \n\nIt was horrific, like it was in slow motion. Those of us that watched it ran over, I still had a cigarette in my mouth. My server friend was stunned, the lady was in incredible pain, it was unreal. \n\nMy buddy quit after that, and I think a lawsuit may have happened. The customer was pretty burned. Fucking bananas to watch. '
b'I would invite them in, give them a table, and explain to them that their server will be with them in about 90 minutes.'
b'I know this is the opposite, but I work at a breakfast spot and weekdays we have 2 servers, we both show up at 6:30, open at 7. Well the other day, my coworker called in and I had 2x the opening side work because we worked together the day before and agreed to finish in the morning. So I\xe2\x80\x99m busy flipping chairs, making coffee, getting ice, etc... and this bitch comes in at 6:58 and flips 3 signs that we have. It was a fair sign of how the day was going to go... '
b'reach out, remove sign and toss to rear of restaurant...."what sign?"'
b"I hate that guy... a fucking lot. Not just because he's a dick but what's worse is that his behavior is encouraging his family to be a bunch of douchebags too"
b'> The funniest part to me is his logic that if the sign says open that means we\xe2\x80\x99re magically open. I\xe2\x80\x99ve watched people flip the sign for us soo many times. Like \xe2\x80\x9cif the professor doesn\xe2\x80\x99t show up for 15 minutes, we\xe2\x80\x99re legally allowed to leave.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWell put. This is so a kid move.'
