b"Yep.\n\nI was in your shoes at 18. My life got a ton better in the next couple of years. The stuff I thought I had fucked up that couldn't be fixed didn't even factor into my life 5 years later.\n\nThe hard lesson was that emotions do not have to kill you. Emotions aren't running the show. You can feel sad or angry and *not do anything about it.* You can also change your actions, which will change your thoughts. If you change your thoughts, your feelings change too. At 18 I had that backwards. I thought I couldn't do anything about my feelings. Small changes in routine can make a huge difference in how you feel.\n"
b"Life is an opportunity, a gift, but the road from addiction is difficult beyond description. We all know that. Still, what doesn't kill you makes your stronger. It's time to hit the reset button and climb out. Use your experience to help others. Let loving-kindness be your light. Start with yourself and learn to love.\n\nThere are some solid thoughts in the other comments - you have sympathy and love from total strangers. Take some of that on board and take the first steps toward a happy, useful life."

b'If they wanted to protect their children, if they truly, really wanted to protect them, they would get them vaccinated. These people do not care one iota about their kids, or any kids, or any other human beings. They\'re worse than idiots, they\'re actually bio-terrorists. They choose to "believe" their fantasy, which makes them feel superior to everyone, \'cause they *know* more, so nobody can tell them anything to make them stop believing in "their truth". Never mind all the scientifically verifiable facts that prove them wrong. Their willful ignorance harms innocent people, young and old, just like a terrorist who thinks they know the way, the one true way and all \'non-believers\' must die/be purified.\n\nYa can\'t fix stupid, and ya can\'t legally kill it. If only there were a super strong vaccine for that!'
b"My husband is 88, and I'm 83.  Last winter, he had to have surgery and I had to take out the trash in sleet, snow, and freezing rain.  We have a long driveway, so that was quite a challenge.  But, I learned to deal with it by dressing warmly.  I figured that if we could manage trash removal on our own, with no help from anyone, we could probably get through just about anything.  And here we are in our own home, one year later, and i'm glad I can still take out the trash. "
b'Littering.  People would just toss trash out the car window and no one thought anything of it.  The sides of the highways were always covered in litter.  I really have no idea why people thought that was OK to do.   \n\n&#x200B;'
b"As a child of the 70's and 80's, I can briefly lay out a few differences/similarities:\n\n* in the 70's, overpopulation and pollution were going to kill the planet. Acid rain and a large hole in the ozone layer were very real threats to our ecosystems. We've since closed the ozone hole and acid rain is no longer a problem. And our ability to sustain our population has improved dramatically.\n* this gave way in the 80's (I may have some of the timing here fuzzy) to fear of nuclear war w/ the Soviet Union, which was enormous and can't be understated. Many of us were sure some dumb accident or macho political posturing would result in nuclear annihilation of the planet. There was a strain of nihilism in our culture at that time (e.g. see some punk rock) that I don't see today.\n* being gay was simply not accepted in a mainstream way as it is today\n* all US Presidents were white men, and no one (including myself) ever thought we'd see a black man in the White House in our lifetimes\n* Republicans were all about law & order, fiscal responsibility, and the Soviet Union was enemy #1.\n* The Taliban were our friends in Afghanistan against our mutual enemy the Soviet Union.\n* Japan produced mostly crap but were starting to climb out of that rep by making the Sony Walkman.\n* Cable TV arrived, vastly expanding our TV viewing options. Then Atari came and brought video games into our homes. Then Apple, Radio Shack, and the Commodore 64 brought personal computers to do the same.\n\nHang in there. Believe it or not, we were in worse shape in some ways before. Sure we'll stumble, but we've come a long way already, and more is yet to come."
b"Not even.  While Trump is a boob we are no where near the lows from my own lifetime.  Just some low points...\n\nI was born in Chicago in April of 1968.  MLK and Robert Kennedy were assassinated, riots and violence convinced my parents to move to Florida.\n\nThe '70s were marred by economic stagnation and inflation at a level that would be thought inconceivable today.  America lost its long war in Vietnam and the President resigned in disgrace rather than face impeachment.  At the end of the 70's my dad got a job at Los Alamos to help try to kill every man woman and child on this planet. Which [kept](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_nuclear_close_calls#9_November_1979) [nearly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_nuclear_close_calls#15_March_1980)\n[happening](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1983_Soviet_nuclear_false_alarm_incident)\n\n"
b"The thing that will kill ya is the booze. I'm telling you this as an active alcoholic. Figure out how not to drink/stick with your sobriety plan.\n\nAll the rest that is breaking your heart? Breathe, be mindful, trust."
b'Not an American here, but from the era of knowing about the Korean War, and the rest as I grew up. Born in 44 and took a degree in History, Philosophy, and Social Change during the 60\'s.\n\nAs per Eisenhower\'s warning, the Military Industrial Complex post WW2 had become a major influence in US defense and political planning. In my view it was because a large number of industrialists got very rich supplying the war effort and R&D on new weapons.\n\nThe war ended and they needed a new enemy if not a new war in order to keep that cash cow mooing. So the Commies became a "threat", despite the conviction that communism was a bankrupt policy doomed to failure. and as we have seen, actual communism leads to internal revolt and replacement of the regime.\n\nSo it appears to me that US military strength is used to protect US commercial interests, and in a side comment, the number of revolutions supported by the CIA  and the support of regional powers in the anti Communist worldwide \'conspiracy\' lead to supporting a large number of pretty vile dictators in order to have some airfields, port facilities and power sources near to the theatre of potential conflicts. Literally billions of dirty money arrive in banking havens due to this Military Industrial Effort.\n\nLook at the 911 fiasco. Think oil. The Saudis became kings and dominating the Arabian peninsula with American military help back around WW1. Fast forward to the 90\'s and the US has a huge investment in oil production, having armed Iran against Iraq for their war, then arming the Saudis against everyone,  And Iraq has Soviet weapons for defense. Then Kuwait declines to purchase weaponry upgrades to counter this, and Iraq is lead to believe the US will stand by idle if they take the oil fields from Kuwait.\n\nGulf war one. Bomb Iraq back to the stone age, ruin their infrastructure And kill off a million or so people, leave feeling like heroes, leave the Kurds feeling betrayed for the uprising encouraged by Bush senior and being stamped out by Saddam. Then the Gulf war 2 where the weapons of mass destruction do not exist and Saddam is willing to be inspected for them. Nope, punish those Iraqis for having a brutal dictator one more time, killing off even more peasants and  brutalizing more American minds.\n\nWhy? Because as any army knows, in order to get the troops to actually kill someone you first have to remove their humanity in the minds of your troops and your citizens. So call them Japs, Call them Commies, call them Rag Heads, whatever it takes to turn them into symbols instead of people. Except the soldiers who do the killing cannot reconcile what they are doing what they did, and they are traumatized. Sometimes for life after seeing and doing things military.\n\nSo as one Marine Corps general wrote in a book, American military power exists to support American business abroad. Its all about the money, all the time. And the people are the ones who do the killing, the dying and carry the burden of shame world wide. You elected those murderous bastards, its up to you to clean their shit up. 500 billionaires trying to get to zero taxes and never serve in the military.\n\nSew an American flag to your back and go anywhere in the world where there are poor people, see if you come back alive. \n\n \n\n&#x200B;'
b"By my own experience, NO.  \n\nI earned a Great Deal of $ when I hit 18, which I 'invested' in nefarious dealings enabling me to do not much more than party with Euro trash until I hit 30, settled down, came back Stateside & got a 'real' job.  \n\nI wouldn't trade those 10 years for any amount of money!  I saw and did things most folks couldn't even begin to imagine, lived a crazy, wonderful, high stress, party life *and it was WONDERFUL.*  You can't travel now the way I did during the 80's, interesting times to be had, for sure.  (Was there for the fall of the Berlin Wall!)\n\nSo now, while I'm debt free, I don't own more than a car, and I'll probably have to work until I die, but I've got an ok job - at least until the government legalizes everywhere & I blow this joint for a job at the weed store, lol  \n\nWrite your own LifeScript and you'll not be disappointed.  What's right for some folks isn't right for others and it does take all kinds to make this world go around.   "
b"Cars in days of yore, through to about the early 80s, had more character. They were more often works of art. And this includes dada art like the AMC Pacer and Matador.\n\nBut they were works of art in the same way that the cursed objects from *Friday the 13th, the Series* were: they tended to kill people a lot more often. Today's cars are so much safer. I'll give up the fun of riding in a piece of art for the increased likelihood that I'll actually arrive there."
