b'I think it\'s not the generation, it\'s the idea of getting old, getting tired, getting ill, and feeling like one has "paid his dues."  It can also come from seeing one\'s country fail hard over a lifetime, and hope dying.\n\nI\'m not saying this is the way it should be.  But in my worst moments, this is what can cause my disrespect of others.'
b"I think the biggest mistake people make is with the partners they choose for relationships. We get so excited at a young age when we meet someone we seem to connect with. It is very powerful when there is a mutual feeling of attraction, both physically and emotionally. But I think there's a tendency to rush ahead too quickly when this happens. I know I did and I regret that.\n\nBefore you commit to someone for life, you should ask yourself these questions:\n\n1. Why do I like this person? What is it about them that I am attracted to?\n2. Have I dealt with any unresolved issues from my childhood? Am I healthy mentally and emotionally? Is it possible that I'm attracted to this person because of some unresolved issues in my life? For example, codependency?\n3. What do I dislike most about this person (hint: whatever this thing is, it never goes away, so you better be ok with it).\n4. Do I feel like I can fix some of the problems this person has in their life? (hint: you can't. And you're codependent).\n5. Has this person had any major depressive issues in their life, or emotional breakdowns? Has this been properly addressed with medication and counseling?\n6. Have you spent much time with their parents and family? If not, do so. If you have, what do you think of them? Specifically, the same sex parent. Generally speaking, girls become their mothers and guys become their fathers.\n7. Have you discussed what you want from life together? Do you both want kids? Do you want one of you to be a stay at home parent? Do you want to live in the city or the suburbs? You may want to sit together and write all of this down. Sometimes, people don't remember these conversations.\n8. Lastly, do you know what is involved with divorce? Specifically child support, custody issues, etc. Not trying to be negative, but the reality is many marriages fall apart and you should know going in how the divorce process works.(hint, it ain't good).\n\nI could go on and on about this. Hope this is helpful for some. "
b'Time really does fly, and bad habits will catch up with you quicker than you think.  Take care of your body and your teeth.  \n\nBeing with nobody is better than being with the wrong body.  If you stay in a crappy relationship, you could miss your chance at meeting the right partner for you.\n\nMake decisions that will allow you to be proud of who you are as a person.\n\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t share pictures of yourself with anyone that you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t mind being seen by everyone who knows you, including your family, boss, spiritual advisor, etc.\n\nPeople treat you the way you allow them to.  Drop anyone who treats you with disrespect.\n\n'
b"I attended high school in a Los Angeles suburb in the late 50s. We had segregated elementary schools and public swimming pool. Housing was segregated in neighborhoods. The place was racially tense with frequent fights on campus. I am 'white' and had friends who weren't. However, we didn't mix after school and cross-racial dating was taboo; get you beaten up by blacks or whites. It took me some time to get my head around racial equality. MLK helped. So did Malcomb. Mainly, my black friends showed the way."
b'Physically yes....I was a pretty young lady in my 20s.  Mentally, spiritually, financially, socially, ....NO!!!\n\nI don\'t think I actually felt like I was in a good place until I was way into my 30\'s.\n\nYou are a child, no disrespect, but to us OLD people, 24 is a child....you have so many years of mistakes and adventures and experiences.\n\nEdit...[Here is a nice thread to read](https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/aq4rq5/image_you_are_always_on_time/) and this line from u/reddit [jSlice\\_\\_](https://www.reddit.com/user/jSlice__)  is just great..." Happiness doesn\'t come from winning, it comes from realizing you don\'t have to compete. "'
b'I find any comment that is based on some physical attribute annoying.  Saying a 5 year old is a "little lady" or "little man," for instance.  Telling little girls they are pretty or little boys how to be manly.   I dislike comments about age, and especially, if one is telling a 70 year old women how young she looks.   \n\nDoesn\'t matter if the speaker believes they are giving a compliment.  Comments like those you list and in categories I list are simply creepy.'
b'I just can stand the division among us and the disrespect for our president and our country. Whether we like him or not, hes our president until next election. We as Americans need to suck it up and control ourselves. You would never see this reaction back in the day. '
b"What great questions! I was not a wanted child and to this day my sister makes sure I never forget. (I'm 66 she is 72) So I lived a life of 'never being enough' and proved it with every relationship I had with men. Married an awful abuser-his dad would take him into the basement with his belt and beat him. He just passed his anger on. After 24 years I left and had a small period of happiness ( a couple of years) all the while seeking acceptance in the wrong places. Bankruptcy, one son stopped talking to me, a string of married men, wicked immoral sex and alcohol happened. Then suddenly I had a job that had benefits and then another job that made a bunch of money! I was genuinely happy for about 11 years. No romantic partner (still none) but trips to exotic places and awards at work. Of course that had to end (/s) by getting an incurable cancer. Skip to today, Cancer is in remission-I cherish every day I'm alive, pain medication that works and chemo that keeps it at bay. My adult, very damaged disabled granddaughter took the place of her also disabled father in my home and she is there for me to cherish and love and give me purpose. It's not easy but I feel this is likely to be the most content years I will have before I die. I've disassociated myself from those family members that disrespect me and work at jobs I love. So. Right now I'm content. Sorry to ramble but there is context behind my answer."
b"> But parent are a very uncomfortable, negative living situation. So if you have kids at home how do you do it.\n\nIt's normal to dislike your parents at one point in life. You're going through an adjustment phase. When I got out of the Marines, I lived with my Dad until... I was 24 or so. Pay them rent(hopefully reduced) and start thinking about what you want to do.\n\nWhat you're going through is completely normal. \n\nIn 10 years you'll be trying to spend as much time with your parents/step parents as possible.\n\nKeep your head down, and get to work. If you'd like to move out, do a sublet or get roommates. It sucks, and you'll have stuff stolen, that's all part of life. \n\nYou've literally got an open canvass on life, and you can make it whatever you would like it to be. you have plenty of time. Stay healthy. While you might think your parents/step parents aren't doing a good job, they are doing the best they can do. Sometimes that's all we can do."
b'In some ways I was born a crazy old cat lady.  But whenever I feel Kids These Days Syndrome creeping in, I remember this:\n\n> *The children now love luxury; they have bad manners, contempt for authority; they show disrespect for elders and love chatter in place of exercise. Children are now tyrants, not the servants of their households. They no longer rise when elders enter the room. They contradict their parents, chatter before company, gobble up dainties at the table, cross their legs, and tyrannize their teachers.*\n>\n> *-Socrates*'
b'I am pretty much a free speech absolutist.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs for an opinion, I like some a dislike alot but what I hate is censorship.'
