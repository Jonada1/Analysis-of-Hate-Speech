b'my current wife does all of these things.\n\nthreatens to kill herself to show the kids what a bad guy i am\n\nthreatens divorce all the time\n\nif i was making enough to properly support two households i would divorce in an instant and fight for 100% custody'
b"I had 2 exs that did all of these. The first one would threaten to kill herself if we didn't have sex or if I didn't do something she wanted. Dealing with that shit weekly definitely changed you. Other one just constantly hit me and call me worthless and whatnot to get a reaction out of me. Finally got out so that's good.\n\nAnyways if you're going through the same situation I'm sorry for you. Shit is never fun it slowly chips away at you one day at a time. If you need a hand feel free to message me \n\nSorry for venting just needed to get that off my chest haha "
