b'- Work hard to provide value to your table. The money will come if they don\xe2\x80\x99t think you\xe2\x80\x99re in it just for the money..\n- All movements should be with a purpose and time-efficient. \n- Help your coworkers, you never know when you\xe2\x80\x99ll need something, and they WON\xe2\x80\x99T forget the one time you didn\xe2\x80\x99t grab them a ranch when they got triple sat 5 months and 2 days ago. \n- Be different. Don\xe2\x80\x99t seem like you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be there and don\xe2\x80\x99t be the extremely ecstatic person. Lots of people aren\xe2\x80\x99t fans of the extremely over the top, happy-go-lucky server. It seems fake and forced. Talk to them like you know them, like they\xe2\x80\x99re your but in a professional way. \n- Don\xe2\x80\x99t let them see you being lazy or doing nothing. You might not think they\xe2\x80\x99re watching, but if their drinks are 1/4 full and they see that you\xe2\x80\x99ve been at the POS talking for the last 4 minutes, they\xe2\x80\x99ll take note. Trust that. \n- FAMILIARIZE YOURSELF WITH THE MENU. If you don\xe2\x80\x99t know the alcohols, the cuts of meat, the amount of sides, the sides, etc..... no bueno. It may seem silly and like a little thing, but I promise you it\xe2\x80\x99s not. \n- DON\xe2\x80\x99T HOVER!!! I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure if people dislike hovering servers or neglectful servers more. In General, it should go like something like this: \n1) Greet, drinks, and apps \n2) Deliver drinks, ask if they\xe2\x80\x99re ready to order or if they need a few more minutes. If they have any questions, tell them feel free to ask. \n3) Take orders\n4) Food comes out. Two bites or two minutes, ask if it came out alright and if it\xe2\x80\x99s tasting ok. \n5) Be check ready. Ask if they need boxes when they\xe2\x80\x99re slowing down, and deliver the check prior to them being done to get the table flipped. \n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s an easy job if you care about the people you\xe2\x80\x99re serving and understand that there will be good and bad tables every day. Don\xe2\x80\x99t be that annoying coworker that cries about every bad tip and tells everyone about your $15 tip. No one cares.\n\nGood luck!'
