b'Contacts.\n1. I dislike any cranial accessories;\n2. chopping onions doesn\xe2\x80\x99t bother me.'
b"When I was younger my mom hated people that were middle/upper class. She would constantly talk badly about them and then as I got older I just automatically assumed that if you had money you were mean, entitled, and would look down on me for not having it. \n\nI started to realize that this wasn't the case with most people when I started to become friends with kids that lived in a more well off family and realized that, yeah their lives looked a bit different from mine, but they didn't dislike me for it. "
b"Publically, only inasmuch as I'm gay.  I don't really signal anymore, and though I donate money to lgbta groups, and volunteer when I have time, I don't organize.  I present femme, and I use she/her pronouns.\n\nBut in my personal life... I've heard and seen enough disrespect, invalidation, and dictation of legitimacy and acceptability from non-gay people that I have no problem going full on Bayard Rustin.\n\n"
b"Death of my dog. Pet deaths in general, especially if you're really bonded. \n\nI really dislike how some people kind of roll their eyes or don't consider that pets can be family members. I had some people ask if or when I was going to get a new one or another one shortly after mine had passed, that was the last thing I wanted to talk about or consider at the moment. "
