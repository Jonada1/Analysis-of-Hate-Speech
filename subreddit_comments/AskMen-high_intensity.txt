b'If you feel you need it I implore you to take action. Waiting can be a dangerous game. I\'ve struggled with depression and anxiety for many years. I kept telling myself "I\'ll go to therapy soon" but I never did amd eventually it got to a point where I cut myself off from everyone, became a shut in, and attempted to kill myself. When I survived I promised myself I would go. My point is, is after a certain point your mind convinces you of things and it will be too late to turn back. '
b'Guy jumped me in 7th grade. Didn\xe2\x80\x99t get a hit on him before the teachers broke it up. Got a week of detention. Because I called the kid a nazi. For attacking me. '
b"In El Salvador some people tried to kill my grandfather while we are in the car with him. It was him, me, and my dad. We were driving somewhere I don't remember too well, when the front and side windows just exploded. I was only four so I don't remember the exact things, but I remember crying on the floor of the car and my grandpa and dad yelling while we drove off. For context my grandpa is a lawyer who dealt with things involving the military during and after the civil war so there have been a few stories involving or about him."
b'I think "abuse" needs to be better defined for a legitimate answer... if you know of someone being physically abused then you have a moral (and in most states, legal) imperative to intervene in some way. Perhaps verbal or emotional abuse that doesn\'t rise to the level of "call the police and/or kill this mother fucker" might be satisfied with a pointed conversation with your friend and (if appropriate) the abuser that next time, you are going to the cops. For someone being "controlled" as a few have noted here, that\'s a grey area that should be viewed case-by-case... every situation is different and some people are more or less dangerous than others. I will say, though, that as someone who has lost a friend to partner violence I would encourage you to err on the side of caution and do whatever you can, within reason, to stop that shit.'
b'Higher Love.  They would kill this song.'
b'I describe myself as "killing time until I die". \n\nI don\'t really have a good reason to kill myself even if I often feel like doing so. There\'s a lot of good things in my life, but I am very isolated and lonely. I feel as though it doens\'t make a difference if I die today or 20 years from now. The result will be the same. I will be dead and some relatives will pillage my savings and throw away all my crap. I won\'t leave any children of my own on this world so to me that makes my entire life worthless and meaningless. \n\nBut my house is paid off, my car paid off, I have money in the bank, a decent job that isn\'t horrible, and lots of free time. I just don\'t have meaning and I\'ve given up trying to find it.'
b'Your friends are arbitrarily drawing a line between their set of experiences and yours and calling that line wisdom.  \n\nHow can we assume you are emotionally mature before you:  \n\n* have children  \n* have a child die  \n* save a life  \n* save the life of a monster who ends up killing ten innocent people  \n* kill a person  \n* kill an innocent person out of fear  \n* kill an innocent person to save ten other innocent people  \n* lead a nation into war  \n* invent a cure for a disease \n* lose a limb  \n* eat 400 micrograms of acid in one go  \n* die  \n* watch a business you started succeed wildly  \n* watch a business you started turn into something horrible the hurts people  \n* etc  \n\n\n'
b'Chores (catboxes, laundry, dishes, trash, etc), masturbate, play guitar, figure out what I\xe2\x80\x99m going to eat, pay bills, balance my register. Boring shit like that during the week. It helps me have more free time on my days off. \n\nI\xe2\x80\x99m 45. '
b'\xe2\x80\x9cSure, but you will have to hand over your phone too and we can both kill the trust in this relationship together\xe2\x80\x9d this hasn\xe2\x80\x99t come up for me luckily '
