b"Growing up I was the youngest by like, a lot. My parents had given up on the whole keeping up with technology thing and never bought a DVD player, even after the VCR broke so I grew up not watching any classic sci fi or fantasy movies despite my nerdy tendencies.\n\nThis lead to a pizza and mountain dew fueled marathon at my sister's house my senior year of highschool where I watched every Star wars, Matrix, Indiana Jones, Lotr, and Jurrasic park movie so that I could fill in the gaps of my nerd knowledge before moving onto college. We also watched Firefly, just cuz.\n\nIt was awesome."
b"Be passionate about things. If there are things you love doing, lean in. Don't be afraid to be that fantasy football nerd with insane spreadsheets predicting the optimal roster based on weather forecasts in different parts of the country. If people ask about your passions, lean the fuck in and tell them all about it.\n\nI am and have always been a huge nerd. I am extremely passionate about things 99.9999% of people don't give a shit about, but people tend to find me interesting because they like seeing someone with passion. I can talk at length to people about Magic the Gathering or discrete mathematics and the only thing that tends to matter for how interesting they find me is how excited I am about the topic. \n\nThere may be people that think you're a loser based on your passions but they are shitty people who you don't want to be friends with anyways. If you fly your flag then people who like what you're on about will pop up and find you interesting."
b"Ryan Gosling overall is just a cool and relatable guy, or his on-screen persona is at least. He's good-looking (obviously), he has a calm but confident demeanor, he's an excellent actor, and he's got some solid nerd cred through his filmography (Blade Runner, Drive, etc). "
