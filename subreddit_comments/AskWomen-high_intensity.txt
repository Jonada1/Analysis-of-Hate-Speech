b'The teachers in my school were extremely cruel.  I certainly didn\xe2\x80\x99t suffer as much as a lot of students.  I was a terrible student but I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t that disruptive so I was just called stupid a lot.  I guess it didn\xe2\x80\x99t really bother me.  I thought they were all to me, just fat old mean men and women ogres.  They were revolting on the inside and outside and just something to deal with.  However looking back it hurts me how they treated poor students or kids with disabilities or physical problems.  Those teachers were abusive and I hope they are all dead.  I can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine how many lives, generations they ruined and how many terrible self fulfilling prophesies they created.  I sincerely hope if you are cruel you do NOT work with children and if you take the job and hate it then go into administration or something.  My school didn\xe2\x80\x99t have the regular bullies like most schools.  We had 50 year olds telling kids they were white trash becasue their clothes had holes in them in front of an entire class.  Or that they were fat becasue they were lazy and they were above reproach unlike regular bullies who sometimes face consequences. \n\nThe black kids had it the worst, unless they played sports.  You can not tell me that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t stay with a person their entire life.  Dispicable.   I remember looking down and rapidly blinking to keep from crying when they berated my classmates and I think that\xe2\x80\x99s what we all did.   It was always worse when it was someone else instead of you.   I guess that\xe2\x80\x99s how we all just thought school and teachers were.  Nobody ever said anything as far as I know becasue none of us knew any better and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure not a god damn person at that school district would have cared anyway. '
b"My mother was saying she wanted to kill herself and that she would kill my siblings before that so they don't suffer. All i could feel back then was deep sadness and heart ache why am i not good enough to be killed too.\nTrying to deal with childhood trauma to this very day and I am 32. Literally affected every aspect in my life but mostly relationships with other people. \n"
b'In the lunch line in high school, I stepped out to throw some paper in a trash can ~4 feet away. The teacher monitoring the line very obviously only saw me stepping back in because she stopped me and told me to move to the back. Even after protests from other students, I still had to go. \n\nI said \xe2\x80\x9cThis is frickin ridiculous\xe2\x80\x9d (those were my EXACT words). I was suspended because she \xe2\x80\x9cknew what I really meant\xe2\x80\x9d by using \xe2\x80\x9cfrickin\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\nSeriously. '
b'I lived in rural Nepal for a month. You get really good at using gestures and figuring out universal signs for everything, I generally didn\xe2\x80\x99t struggle with getting my point across. The hardest part was getting travelers stomach in an area with high HIV/AIDS rates and trying to explain why I am refusing any IV fluids or anti-nausea injections (at that point I was getting sick into a trash can filled with used needles so I think I was justifiably wary). Google translate was my best friend at that point because it made everything so much faster communication-wise. Also having a list of single words in the native language such as \xe2\x80\x9cbathroom\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cEnglish\xe2\x80\x9d was invaluable. '
b'The DMs from angry dudes calling me a \'Man hating c\\*\\*\\*\', and telling me I should kill myself, for saying I hated that men would send unsolicited penis photos, and described it as "Disappointing Penis Roulette".  \nIt was a response to a question here, about what is the most frustrating part of being single, or something like that.'
b'He was trying to kill the Beast in order to claim Belle for himself.  I don\'t know that I would say he "deserved" to die but certainly Karma played out in that direction.'
b"I think so.  Trying to imprison someone's father to force them to marry you is pretty terrible.  If it's the live action, he actually tried to kill Maurice which is even more terrible.\n\n\nI don't know much about French justice then, but I'm pretty sure he was looking at death anyway he went.  I think he deserved it. "
b'Cat food lol. I buy top of the line. His fur is the softest and makes it all worth it. I could eat trash, as long as the cat is well fed.'
b'A good winter jacket. Shoes, when I need them, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been wearing the same suede booties from American Eagle since high school and finally put them in the trash (\xf0\x9f\x92\x94\xf0\x9f\x98\xad) but splurging in a new pair was necessary, so no guilt. Also healthy groceries and a good mani.'
