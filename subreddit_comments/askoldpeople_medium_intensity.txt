b"Born early 80s. Lived in a white suburb in the north, had a black bff, one of 2 black families in the whole neighborhood. My brother was friends with the boy from the other black family. No harassment for her being black. I was plenty picked on for being a lame nerd, but my friend was much more popular than I was so if anything, she helped me out in that regard.\n\nAs small children, we didn't really know what race was. As we got older, we were fairly 'woke' and knew that racism was bad. You are not the first generation to know that being racist isn't ok."
