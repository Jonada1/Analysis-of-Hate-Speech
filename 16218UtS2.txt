b'No problem. And I\xe2\x80\x99m trying, right now the difficulty for me is learning to live with the knowledge that I can\xe2\x80\x99t reach out to her to apologize. The whole \xe2\x80\x9cif you love them let them go\xe2\x80\x9d spiel still keeps me conflicted. I may try to in a few more years, but as for now I\xe2\x80\x99ll stick with anonymous internet posts.

b'For me, I feel that I\xe2\x80\x99ve changed a lot. A few years ago I was in a somewhat open, online relationship with my best friend. Essentially, we both felt we were soul mates who just couldn\xe2\x80\x99t make it work over distance at a young age where neither of us could move and be independent. \n\nI was never physically abusive (cue the, \xe2\x80\x9cduh it\xe2\x80\x99s a long-distance relationship\xe2\x80\x9d reply. But we did meet in person eventually), but I was constantly emotionally abusive. I took advantage of her willingness to forgive me and justified my sexual impulsiveness by my own immaturity on far too many occasions. Needless to say it crippled our relationship in the end, with her ultimately coming out of her shell and realizing she deserves better and felt confident in making that clear. \n\nI accept full responsibility for what I did and I won\xe2\x80\x99t lie that I think of it often and it makes me feel like utter shit. I\xe2\x80\x99m thankful for the lessons I\xe2\x80\x99ve learned because of it, but it\xe2\x80\x99s an awful feeling knowing I am responsible for the pain someone I care about feels. We don\xe2\x80\x99t talk anyone, not because I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to but because her current girlfriend has recommended she block on all media (I understand why). \n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s been a few years now but it\xe2\x80\x99s still rather fresh. I have a new girlfriend now and am consciously employing the lessons I learned from before. It feels, strange (?) to be the one to claim I\xe2\x80\x99ve changed since I was abusive but I feel that at least to a small extent I have. \n\nI apologize if this wasn\xe2\x80\x99t what you were looking for, but I\xe2\x80\x99ve also been looking for an outlet to talk about this experience in hopes of feeling better and helping other navigate relationships. In short, if you need an excuse to attempt to justify it in your mind, face the reality that what you\xe2\x80\x99re doing is manipulative. For me, acknowledgment isn\xe2\x80\x99t enough, you need to actively work on being better. '
b'Bastion! Super cheap and absolutely gorgeous, I almost failed my science class in HS cause I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t stop playing it during class'
